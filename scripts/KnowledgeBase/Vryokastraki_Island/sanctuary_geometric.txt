On the southern upper plateau of the islet, a monumental relief, nearly twenty two meters long, was discovered which can tentatively be dated to the classical times both from its isostructural masonry and from the pottery collected within the layer of lapis associated with its construction.
The findings are of exceptional quality pottery from the Geometric and Archaic periods, as well as some findings of an undoubtedly votive nature.
At a distance of five meters east of the analemma, the carved rock forms a rectangular outcrop that is highly eroded today, appears to be identified with a monumental altar.
The embankment forms a kind of platform four point five meters high, to the west of which the natural rock forms a spacious cairn with numerous traces of ancient excavations, some of which seem to relate to some monumental temple which was apparently founded here.
The identity of the worshiped deity remains unknown at present.
Excellent quality ceramics of the Geometric and Archaic periods were collected from the area.
The shapes are mainly small closed ones, such as hydrias, oenochoes and fountains, while there is no shortage of miniatures.
Among the finds are a few clay figurines, mostly of female figures, and some bronze votives, such as miniature buckles and other jewelry.
The finds here probably refer to some female deity.
The finds lead to the conclusion that the rampart was built during classical times in order to create a foundation for the construction of a temple, of which only some excavations are preserved in the bedrock as the settlement of the Early Christian period developed in the area.
