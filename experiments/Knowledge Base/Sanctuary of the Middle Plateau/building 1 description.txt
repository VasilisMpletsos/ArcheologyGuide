The Building 1 was a cult building where the worship of the god Asklepios and the goddess Aphrodite was done. Also it housed the worship of other Samothracian Gods.
The walls of the building were plastered with red mortar which survives its original placement in some places, both internally and externally.
It was also a place where dinners were held. It has Doric portico, which in its original phase was single or more likely abolished, in Roman times by the construction of a transverse wall.
In the southeast corner of the building is the opening of the water tank, carved into the natural rock.
