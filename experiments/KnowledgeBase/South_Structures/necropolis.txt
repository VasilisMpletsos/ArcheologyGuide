The ancient city had two necropolises outside the walls.
The main cemetery of the ancient city occupies a large area outside the southern part of the wall, while groups of tombs can also be seen outside the northwestern gate.
From the excavations of the years from one thousand ninty one to ninty six, to an area of approximately four hundred square meter sixty eight (68) burials were found.
Out of the 68 burials that came to light, 62 were found arrested and only 6 unclaimed.
Out of the total number of graves, 41 definitely belong to adults, 17 graves that were found very damaged seem to have belonged to adults as well, while only 8 of the total were children's and two of infants.
Few skeletons are preserved in good condition, so it is difficult to identify the sex and age of the individuals.
Of the total number of graves, 66 are box-shaped carved into the natural rock and there is only one inhumation in a sharp-bottomed amphora, although a child's burial in a beehive.
The graves were carved densely and almost parallel to each other on the downhill slope of the diocese.
From the fragments of vessels recovered from most of the burials it appears that almost all the graves were endowed.
The usual grave offerings were vessels, and these are mainly vessels of small size, such as olpes, lekythia and incense containers, but also drinking vessels, such as kyathia and scyphidia.
The most common grave goods are lamps, which were found in all the box-shaped undisturbed graves.
