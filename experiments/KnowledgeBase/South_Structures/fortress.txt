In the southern sector of the acropolis, two building complexes (Buildings one and two) were excavated, which appear to have been built in the early Archaic period and remained in use until at least the Hellenistic period.
Both the nature of the remains and the few findings allow us to speculate that the Southern part of the acropolis was intended for habitats of perhaps a military nature.
Here it would be possible to be the headquarters of the Macedonian garrison that Philip E established in Kythnos in 201 BC.
