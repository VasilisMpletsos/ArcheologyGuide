The southernmost one (Building one) is a cult building in which, based on the sculptures and inscriptions that emerged from both the interior of the Building and the adjacent reservoir, the worship of the god Asklepios and the goddess Aphrodite was housed. 
It is possible that the building also housed the worship of the Samothracian Gods, based on an inscribed stele found embedded in a newer building. It is an oblong building with dimensions of seventeen point fourty Ã— eleven point fifty meters, made of slate, which consists of two independent rooms opening to the east on a Doric portico, from which the building was accessed. 
It is erected on a strong rise in the west, with a maximum surviving height of two point eighty meters. 
The walls of the building were plastered with red mortar which survives its original placement in some places, both internally and externally.
Regarding the internal layout of the rooms, the northernmost room preserves a large part of the pebbled floor. 
In contact with the wall on the north-east side, a three-meter raised strip is also preserved, consisting of smaller pebbles. 
According to the excavator, the different configuration of the pebbles in contact with the wall is a clear indication of the placement of couches around the perimeter of the walls, possibly for holding dinners or for sleeping. 
The smaller Space C preserves the foundation of a pedestal, measuring one twenty x zero eighty meters, probably intended to support a cult statue. 
The Doric portico, which in its original phase was single, was divided, or more likely abolished, in Roman times by the construction of a transverse wall, aligned with the intermediate wall of Rooms A and C, changing the layout of the building and by extension dividing the in two separate buildings.
In contact with the pilaster, in the southeast corner of the building is the opening of the ugly water tank, carved into the natural rock. 
The filling of the tank was achieved through an overflow channel, which connected the tank to the collector (one twenty meters deep and one meter in diameter) located south and in contact with that of the tank. 
The water was directed from the roof to the collector and ended up in the tank through a pipe. The interior of both the collector and the tank was covered with hydraulic mortar, making the tank watertight. 
The proximity of the reservoir to the building attests to the inseparable relationship between the two and that the water collected was intended for the needs of the sanctuary, while the collector could also serve as a purification tank.
At the same time, important finds came from the tank, such as a marble head of Asclepius from the late Hellenistic period, as well as an inscribed colonnade of the first second century, dedicated to Asclepius by a certain Callisto, while fragments of marble child figurines came from, a category of votives found in sanctuaries of the god Asclepius. 
Also collected were a small head of Aphrodite from the Hellenistic period, and a clay head of Demeter from a large figurine from the late classical period. 
Remarkable, finally, is the presence within the reservoir, towards the deeper layers of the excavated embankment, two human femurs whose dating has not yet been determined.
In addition to the finds from the interior of the cistern, findings such as a votive inscription to Aphrodite Syria, built into the intermediate wall of Building one in second use, a marble statue of Aphrodite and the lower part of a marble female of a statue that had been found a short distance lower than Buildings one and two, and probably belonged according to Panagiotis Themelis to the colossal statue of Aphrodite in the Anadyomeni type, which was crafted by the Messenian sculptor Damophon I make clear the co-cult of Asclepius and Aphrodite.
This building is dated to the late Classical to early Hellenistic times.
From the surface survey, numerous objects were collected that indicate the cultic function of the plateau.
Examining the sanctuaries of the city as a whole, the habit of worshiping two or more deities is observed.
The earliest vessels of the sanctuary bear written decoration. 
Fourty seven fragments of vessels with written decorations were found from different time periods.
The earliest ceramic evidence from the building belongs to the Protogeometric period.
Most of the fragments belong to the Middle and Late Geometric, and the largest percentage of them came from the pities layer.
The majority of shells, belonging to closed shapes of the Geometric period, bear linear decoration.
Fewer in number are the vessels of the Archaic and Classical periods with written decoration, mainly large open vessels, such as kraters and basins, but also smaller ones, such as bowls and baskets.
