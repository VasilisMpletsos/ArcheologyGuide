It is considered as the ancient capital of the island. It was inhabited from the 12th century BC until the Early Middle Ages.
It was called Kythnos in the ancient times and the island was named after it.
It is also referred to as Ovriokastro and Rigokastro.
Vryokastro is on the northwestern side of the island, between the bays of Merichas and Apokrisi.
The town had an area of 300 acres and was surrounded by city walls ncluding the islet Vryokastraki, which was formerly connected to the coast by a narrow isthmus.
Underwater surveys and excavations show that before the sea level rise, which resulted in the separation of the rocky islet from the coast, there were buildings which are now in the water along with the now underwater walls.
It is the most fully researched and excavated site of the island.
The excavation of the area is ongoing.
To date, public buildings, an aqueduct, an acropolis, two necropolises, a harbor, a sanctuary, a temple, a monumental mound and a large building of the Classical and Hellenistic period have been found in the settlement's area.
Vryokastraki was excavated from 2018 to 2020 and its findings document the human presence in the 12th century BC on the island.
In the upper city a sanctuary complex was found that probably were temples for Asclepius, Cabeiri, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Artemis.
West of the sanctuary the city's Agora during the Hellenistic period was found.
