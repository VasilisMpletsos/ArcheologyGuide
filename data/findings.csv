"Here the sub-foundation of a pedestal, intended to support a cult statue, is preserved. It is possible that the cult statue of the goddess, the work of Damophon, was erected, a fragment of which was found rolled on the slope a short distance below the building. Of course, the space could house the worship of both deities and perhaps a cult statue of Asclepius as well"
"A marble statue of a half-naked Aphrodite from the Hellenistic period that was found here, fallen at the base of the building's analemma under the area with the pedestal. It helped to connect the building with the worship of Aphrodite."
"Here is the opening of the hideous water tank, carved into the natural rock and plastered with hydraulic mortar."
"A copper bucket with iron lavas was found inside the tank, with which they collected water.The marble head of the god Asklepios also came from inside the tank."

From here access to the upper floor was achieved via a monumental staircase in the middle of the building which led to an internal paved courtyard and from there to the apartments.
"Here a cavity was discovered that contained a lot of ash, charcoal, and numerous findings of a public-commercial as well as religious nature. Among them clay female figurines, small intact drinking vessels, a wine decanter, an iron handbook and lead weights."
"You are in room Z, the function of which remains unknown, but it may have been the restaurant where the rectors and visitors of the city were fed and entertained for free."
