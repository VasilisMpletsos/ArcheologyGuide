passages
"in addition to the buildings connected with the religious life of the city, an important public building that came to light is the building complex that was revealed on the northwest side of the middle plateau, on the plateau that develops lower than the archaic temple (building three) to the west, where it was probably located the market of hellenistic times"
"it is a two-story building of the late classical period, measuring seventeen by ten meters. it presents at least two main architectural phases"
the oldest dates back to around the middle of the fourth century
"the building seems to have suffered some destruction and significant repair during the hellenistic period, probably in the second century"
"a monumental staircase in the middle of the building led to the first floor, where the apparently official apartments were located: room a with the liturgical hearth, the b and c with paved floor (and partly shaped natural rock) probably used for meals, north west room g whose use remains unknown (it survived at a level below the floor) and a series of rooms that must have had wooden floors, above spaces d and h, south of the scale and f-t, north of it"
room f seems to have been the place where most of the utensils and objects related to the use of the building were kept
this is also where the food preparation must have taken place
"after all, as we mentioned above, room f communicated with the upper floor, where the official rooms of the public building must have been, by the internal staircase"
the small underground room h was certainly a storeroom (of pitheons?)
access here must have been through a hatch in the wooden floor of the first floor
"room d seems to have been a storage room as well, and in the first phase it may have communicated with room h, with an opening in its ne corner"
room h may have been the original from αrchaic times
"it is not excluded that d also communicated with room e and the staircase, if we accept that wall t thirteen is a later addition when it was decided after the first disaster that the building suffered to fill the room with soil that contained almost all its contents room f"
"the south east hall was paved, while a hearth was found in the northeast"
"we assume that it is a building of a public, perhaps even commercial character, while the construction in the middle of the north-eastern room seems to have had a religious purpose"
"perhaps it is the sacred hearth, where the goddess hestia is worshiped and burns an unquenchable flame of the city"
"the findings allow the building to be dated to the classical period, although the presence of numerous finds from the hellenistic period in the immediate embankments of the building probably indicate the use of the building during hellenistic times as well"
"the possible public character of building five combined with the findings of the adjacent monumental analemma four do not rule out the version that in this area was the sought-after agora of the ancient city of kythnos and the building is probably identified with its rectory, while it is not excluded that it is identified with market law"
"it was proven that the main bulk of the material, which was once contained in this chamber, was piously dumped in room d sometime during the first half of the second century bc"
"according to the data it is beyond doubt that building 5 was a public building, constructed in the late classical period and repaired in the early second century bc"
it is dated from late classical period (4th century) to late hellenistic period (1st century bc).it is made out of shale
"classical greece was a period of around 200 years  in ancient greece, marked by much of the eastern aegean and northern regions of greek culture  gaining increased autonomy from the persian empire; the peak flourishing of democratic athens; the first and second peloponnesian wars; the spartan and then theban hegemonies; and the expansion of macedonia under philip ii"
"much of the early defining politics, artistic thought , scientific thought, theatre, literature and philosophy of western civilization derives from this period of greek history, which had a powerful influence on the later roman empire"
"part of the broader era of classical antiquity, the classical greek era ended after philip ii's unification of most of the greek world against the common enemy of the persian empire, which was conquered within 13 years during the wars of alexander the great, philip's son"
"in the context of the art, architecture, and culture of ancient greece, the classical period corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries bc"
the classical period in this sense follows the greek dark ages and archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the hellenistic period
"this century is essentially studied from the athenian outlook because athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works than any of the other ancient greek states"
"from the perspective of athenian culture in classical greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century bc extends slightly into the 6th century bc"
"in this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 508 bc, with the fall of the last athenian tyrant and cleisthenes' reforms"
"however, a broader view of the whole greek world might place its beginning at the ionian revolt of 500 bc, the event that provoked the persian invasion of 492 bc"
the persians were defeated in 490 bc
"a second persian attempt, in 481–479 bc, failed as well, despite having overrun much of modern-day greece  at a crucial point during the war following the battle of thermopylae and the battle of artemisium"
"the delian league then formed, under athenian hegemony and as athens' instrument"
"athens' successes caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but athenian dynamism finally awoke sparta and brought about the peloponnesian war in 431 bc"
"after both forces were spent, a brief peace came about; then the war resumed to sparta's advantage"
"athens was definitively defeated in 404 bc, and internal athenian agitations mark the end of the 5th century bc in greece"
"since its beginning, sparta had been ruled by a diarchy. this meant that sparta had two kings ruling concurrently throughout its entire history"
"the two kingships were both hereditary, vested in the agiad dynasty and the eurypontid dynasty"
"according to legend, the respective hereditary lines of these two dynasties sprang from eurysthenes and procles, twin descendants of hercules"
they were said to have conquered sparta two generations after the trojan war
"in 510 bc, spartan troops helped the athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant hippias, son of peisistratos"
"cleomenes i, king of sparta, put in place a pro-spartan oligarchy headed by isagoras"
"but his rival cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by pro-democracy citizens, took over"
"cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 bc, but could not stop cleisthenes, now supported by the athenians"
"through cleisthenes' reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens —and established ostracism"
"the isonomic and isegoric  democracy was first organized into about 130 demes, which became the basic civic element"
"the 10,000 citizens exercised their power as members of the assembly , headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random"
"the city's administrative geography was reworked, in order to create mixed political groups: not federated by local interests linked to the sea, to the city, or to farming, whose decisions  would depend on their geographical position"
"the territory of the city was also divided into thirty trittyes as follows: ten trittyes in the coastal region  ten trittyes in the ἄστυ , the urban centre ten trittyes in the rural interior,"
"a tribe consisted of three trittyes, selected at random, one from each of the three groups"
each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors
it was this corpus of reforms that allowed the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s bc
"in ionia , the greek cities, which included great centres such as miletus and halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the persian empire in the mid-6th century bc"
"in 499 bc that region's greeks rose in the ionian revolt, and athens and some other greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 bc at the battle of lade"
"asia minor returned to persian control. in 492 bc, the persian general mardonius led a campaign through thrace and macedonia"
"he was victorious and again subjugated the former and conquered the latter, but he was wounded and forced to retreat back into asia minor"
"in addition, a fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of mount athos"
"later, the generals artaphernes and datis led a successful naval expedition against the aegean islands"
"in 490 bc, darius the great, having suppressed the ionian cities, sent a persian fleet to punish the greeks"
"they landed in attica intending to take athens, but were defeated at the battle of marathon by a greek army of 9,000 athenian hoplites and 1,000 plataeans led by the athenian general miltiades"
"the persian fleet continued to athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault"
"in 480 bc, darius' successor xerxes i sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the hellespont"
"this army took thrace, before descending on thessaly and boeotia, whilst the persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops"
"the greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block cape artemision"
"after being delayed by leonidas i, the spartan king of the agiad dynasty, at the battle of thermopylae , xerxes advanced into attica, and captured and burned athens"
"the subsequent battle of artemisium resulted in the capture of euboea, bringing most of mainland greece north of the isthmus of corinth under persian control"
"however, the athenians had evacuated the city of athens by sea before thermopylae, and under the command of themistocles, they defeated the persian fleet at the battle of salamis"
"in 483 bc, during the period of peace between the two persian invasions, a vein of silver ore had been discovered in the laurion , and the hundreds of talents mined there were used to build 200 warships to combat aeginetan piracy"
"a year later, the greeks, under the spartan pausanias, defeated the persian army at plataea"
"the persians then began to withdraw from greece, and never attempted an invasion again"
"the athenian fleet then turned to chasing the persians from the aegean sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the battle of mycale; then in 478 bc the fleet captured byzantium"
"at that time athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the delian league, so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of delos"
"the spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power"
in 431 bc war broke out between athens and sparta
"the war was a struggle not merely between two city-states but rather between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states: the delian league, led by athens, and the peloponnesian league, led by sparta"
delian league the delian league grew out of the need to present a unified front of all greek city-states against persian aggression
"in 481 bc, greek city-states, including sparta, met in the first of a series of ""congresses"" that strove to unify all the greek city-states against the danger of another persian invasion"
"the coalition that emerged from the first congress was named the ""hellenic league"" and included sparta"
"persia, under xerxes, invaded greece in september 481 bc, but the athenian navy defeated the persian navy"
"the persian land forces were delayed in 480 bc by a much smaller force of 300 spartans, 400 thebans and 700 men from boeotian thespiae at the battle of thermopylae"
the persians left greece in 479 bc after their defeat at plataea.plataea was the final battle of xerxes' invasion of greece
"after this, the persians never again tried to invade greece"
"with the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the hellenic league"
"in 477, athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include sparta"
"this coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of delos. thus, the league took the name ""delian league"""
"thus, the league took the name ""delian league"". its formal purpose was to liberate greek cities still under persian control"
"however, it became increasingly apparent that the delian league was really a front for athenian hegemony throughout the aegean"
"peloponnesian  league a competing coalition of greek city-states centred around sparta arose, and became more important as the external persian threat subsided"
this coalition is known as the peloponnesian league
"however, unlike the hellenic league and the delian league, this league was not a response to any external threat, persian or otherwise: it was unabashedly an instrument of spartan policy aimed at sparta's security and spartan dominance over the peloponnese peninsula"
"the term ""peloponnesian league"" is a misnomer. it was not really a ""league"" at all. nor was it really ""peloponnesian"""
"nor was it really ""peloponnesian"". there was no equality at all between the members, as might be implied by the term ""league"""
"furthermore, most of its members were located outside the peloponnese peninsula"
"the terms ""spartan league"" and ""peloponnesian league"" are modern terms"
"contemporaries instead referred to ""lacedaemonians and their allies"" to describe the ""league"""
"the league had its origins in sparta's conflict with argos, another city on the peloponnese peninsula"
in the 7th century bc argos dominated the peninsula
even in the early 6th century the argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the peninsula
the rise of sparta in the 6th century brought sparta into conflict with argos
"however, with the conquest of the peloponnesian city-state of tegea in 550 bc and the defeat of the argives in 546 bc the spartans' control began to reach well beyond the borders of laconia"
"as the two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict"
"under the influence of king archidamus ii , sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 bc, concluded the thirty years peace with athens"
"this treaty took effect the next winter in 445 bc under the terms of this treaty, greece was formally divided into two large power zones"
sparta and athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's
"despite the thirty years peace, it was clear that war was inevitable"
"as noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 bc, sparta was a ""diarchy"" with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently"
one line of hereditary kings was from the eurypontid dynasty while the other king was from the agiad dynasty
"with the signing of the thirty years peace treaty, archidamus ii felt he had successfully prevented sparta from entering into a war with its neighbours"
"however, the strong war party in sparta soon won out and in 431 bc archidamus was forced to go to war with the delian league"
"however, in 427 bc, archidamus ii died and his son, agis ii succeeded to the eurypontid throne of sparta"
the immediate causes of the peloponnesian war vary from account to account
"however three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely thucydides and plutarch"
"prior to the war, corinth and one of its colonies, corcyra , went to war in 435 bc over the new corcyran colony of epidamnus"
sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle
"in 433 bc, corcyra sought athenian assistance in the war. corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of athens"
"however, to further encourage athens to enter the conflict, corcyra pointed out how useful a friendly relationship with corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of corcyra itself and the colony of epidamnus on the east shore of the adriatic sea"
"furthermore, corcyra promised that athens would have the use of corcyra's navy, the third-largest in greece"
"this was too good of an offer for athens to refuse. accordingly, athens signed a defensive alliance with corcyra"
"the next year, in 432 bc, corinth and athens argued over control of potidaea , eventually leading to an athenian siege of potidaea"
"in 434–433 bc athens issued the ""megarian decrees"", a series of decrees that placed economic sanctions on the megarian people"
"the peloponnesian league accused athens of violating the thirty years peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, sparta formally declared war on athens"
many historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war
they would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of sparta and its allies at the dominance of athens over greek affairs
"the war lasted 27 years, partly because athens  and sparta  found it difficult to come to grips with each other"
"sparta's initial strategy was to invade attica, but the athenians were able to retreat behind their walls"
"an outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused many deaths, including that of pericles"
"at the same time the athenian fleet landed troops in the peloponnesus, winning battles at naupactus  and pylos"
"however, these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory"
"after several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate athenian leader nicias concluded the peace of nicias"
"in 418 bc, however, conflict between sparta and the athenian ally argos led to a resumption of hostilities"
alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the athenians to ally with argos against the spartans
at the mantinea sparta defeated the combined armies of athens and her allies
"accordingly, argos and the rest of the peloponnesus was brought back under the control of sparta"
the return of peace allowed athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order
"soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into athens"
"a strong ""peace party"" arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the athenian empire"
"concentration on the athenian empire, however, brought athens into conflict with another greek state"
"the melian expedition  ever since the formation of the delian league in 477 bc, the island of melos had refused to join"
"by refusing to join the league, however, melos reaped the benefits of the league without bearing any of the burdens"
"in 425 bc, an athenian army under cleon attacked melos to force the island to join the delian league"
"however, melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality"
further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 bc the mood of the people in athens was inclined toward military adventure
the island of melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party
"furthermore, there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party"
enforcement of the economic obligations of the delian league upon rebellious city-states and islands was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of athens could be assured
melos alone among all the cycladic islands located in the south-west aegean sea had resisted joining the delian league
this continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the delian league
the debate between athens and melos over the issue of joining the delian league is presented by thucydides in his melian dialogue
"the debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between melos and athens and melos was invaded in 416 bc, and soon occupied by athens"
this success on the part of athens whetted the appetite of the people of athens for further expansion of the athenian empire
"accordingly, the people of athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by alcibiades"
"the sicilian expedition  thus, in 415 bc, alcibiades found support within the athenian assembly for his position when he urged that athens launch a major expedition against syracuse, a peloponnesian ally in sicily, magna graecia"
"segesta, a town in sicily, had requested athenian assistance in their war with another sicilian town—the town of selinus"
"although nicias was a sceptic about the sicilian expedition, he was appointed along with alcibiades to lead the expedition"
"however, unlike the expedition against melos, the citizens of athens were deeply divided over alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far-off sicily"
"in june 415 bc, on the very eve of the departure of the athenian fleet for sicily, a band of vandals in athens defaced the many statues of the god hermes that were scattered throughout the city of athens"
this action was blamed on alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign
"in all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of hermes was the action of the peace party"
"having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken alcibiades' hold on the people of athens"
successfully blaming alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened alcibiades and the war party in athens
"furthermore, it is unlikely that alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet"
such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated
"even before the fleet reached sicily, word arrived to the fleet that alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of hermes, prompting alcibiades to flee to sparta"
"when the fleet later landed in sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster"
the entire expeditionary force was lost and nicias was captured and executed. this was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of athens
"alcibiades in sparta meanwhile, alcibiades betrayed athens and became a chief advisor to the spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land"
alcibiades persuaded the spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time—large enough to challenge the athenian superiority at sea
"additionally, alcibiades persuaded the spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes—the persians"
"as noted below, alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in sparta when he was accused of having seduced timaea, the wife of agis ii, the eurypontid king of sparta"
"accordingly, alcibiades was required to flee from sparta and seek the protection of the persian court"
"persia intervenes in the persian court, alcibiades now betrayed both athens and sparta"
"he encouraged persia to give sparta financial aid to build a navy, advising that long and continuous warfare between sparta and athens would weaken both city-states and allow the persians to dominate the greek peninsula"
"among the war party in athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to sicily in 415–413 could have been avoided if alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition"
"thus, despite his treacherous flight to sparta and his collaboration with sparta and later with the persian court, there arose a demand among the war party that alcibiades be allowed to return to athens without being arrested"
"alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the athenian-controlled island of samos. alcibiades felt that ""radical democracy"" was his worst enemy"
"accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in athens"
if the coup were successful alcibiades promised to return to athens
"in 411, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in athens, by a group which became known as ""the 400"""
"however, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in samos failed. alcibiades was immediately made an admiral  in the athenian navy"
"later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 were replaced by a broader oligarchy called ""the 5000"". alcibiades did not immediately return to athens"
"in early 410, alcibiades led an athenian fleet of 18 triremes against the persian-financed spartan fleet at abydos near the hellespont"
"the battle of abydos had actually begun before the arrival of alcibiades, and had been inclining slightly toward the athenians"
"however, with the arrival of alcibiades, the athenian victory over the spartans became a rout"
only the approach of nightfall and the movement of persian troops to the coast where the spartans had beached their ships saved the spartan navy from total destruction
"following alcibiades' advice, the persian empire had been playing sparta and athens off against each other"
"however, as weak as the spartan navy was after the battle of abydos, the persian navy directly assisted the spartans"
"alcibiades then pursued and met the combined spartan and persian fleets at the battle of cyzicus later in the spring of 410, achieving a significant victory"
"lysander and the end of the war with the financial help of the persians, sparta built a fleet to challenge athenian naval supremacy"
"with the new fleet and new military leader lysander, sparta attacked abydos, seizing the strategic initiative"
"by occupying the hellespont, the source of athens' grain imports, sparta effectively threatened athens with starvation"
"in response, athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront lysander, but were decisively defeated at aegospotami"
the loss of her fleet threatened athens with bankruptcy
"in 404 bc athens sued for peace, and sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions"
"lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the ""thirty tyrants"" to govern athens"
"meanwhile, in sparta, timaea gave birth to a child"
"the child was given the name leotychidas, after the great grandfather of agis ii—king leotychidas of sparta"
"however, because of timaea's alleged affair with alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young leotychidas was fathered by alcibiades"
"indeed, agis ii refused to acknowledge leotychidas as his son until he relented, in front of witnesses, on his deathbed in 400 bc"
"upon the death of agis ii, leotychidas attempted to claim the eurypontid throne for himself, but this was met with an outcry, led by lysander, who was at the height of his influence in sparta"
"lysander argued that leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the eurypontid throne; instead he backed the hereditary claim of agesilaus, son of agis by another wife"
"with lysander's support, agesilaus became the eurypontid king as agesilaus ii, expelled leotychidas from the country, and took over all of agis' estates and property"
"related articles: spartan hegemony and theban hegemonythe end of the peloponnesian war left sparta the master of greece, but the narrow outlook of the spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role"
within a few years the democratic party regained power in athens and in other cities
"in 395 bc the spartan rulers removed lysander from office, and sparta lost her naval supremacy"
"athens, argos, thebes, and corinth, the latter two former spartan allies, challenged sparta's dominance in the corinthian war, which ended inconclusively in 387 bc"
that same year sparta shocked the greeks by concluding the treaty of antalcidas with persia
"the agreement turned over the greek cities of ionia and cyprus, reversing a hundred years of greek victories against persia"
"sparta then tried to further weaken the power of thebes, which led to a war in which thebes allied with its old enemy athens"
then the theban generals epaminondas and pelopidas won a decisive victory at leuctra
"the result of this battle was the end of spartan supremacy and the establishment of theban dominance, but athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of thebes was short-lived"
with the death of epaminondas at mantinea  the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with phocis
"in 346 bc the thebans appealed to philip ii of macedon to help them against the phocians, thus drawing macedon into greek affairs for the first time"
the peloponnesian war was a radical turning point for the greek world
"before 403 bc, the situation was more defined, with athens and its allies , and other states outside this athenian empire"
the sources denounce this athenian supremacy  as smothering and disadvantageous
"after 403 bc, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived"
"the first of these turnarounds was managed by athens as early as 390 bc, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory"
this empire was powerful but short-lived
"in 405 bc, the spartans were masters of all—of athens' allies and of athens itself—and their power was undivided"
"by the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. as noted above, in 400 bc, agesilaus became king of sparta"
foundation of a spartan empire the subject of how to reorganize the athenian empire as part of the spartan empire provoked much heated debate among sparta's full citizens
the admiral lysander felt that the spartans should rebuild the athenian empire in such a way that sparta profited from it
lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others
"prior to this, spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots  and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property"
"without the spartans' support, lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him—on samos, for example, festivals known as lysandreia were organized in his honour"
"he was recalled to sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters. sparta refused to see lysander or his successors dominate"
"not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 bc not to support the directives that he had made"
agesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century bc
"this accidental accession meant that, unlike the other spartan kings, he had the advantage of a spartan education"
the spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the spartan state
agesilaus employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the persian empire
"once again, the persian empire played both sides against each other"
"the persian court supported sparta in the rebuilding of their navy while simultaneously funding the athenians, who used persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls  as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories"
"for most of the first years of his reign, agesilaus had been engaged in a war against persia in the aegean sea and in asia minor"
"in 394 bc, the spartan authorities ordered agesilaus to return to mainland greece"
"while agesilaus had a large part of the spartan army in asia minor, the spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces led by corinth"
at the battle of haliartus the spartans had been defeated by the theban forces
"worse yet, lysander, sparta's chief military leader, had been killed during the battle"
"this was the start of what became known as the ""corinthian war"""
"upon hearing of the spartan loss at haliartus and of the death of lysander, agesilaus headed out of asia minor, back across the hellespont, across thrace and back towards greece"
"at the battle of coronea, agesilaus and his spartan army defeated a theban force"
"during the war, corinth drew support from a coalition of traditional spartan enemies—argos, athens and thebes"
"however, when the war descended into guerilla tactics, sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with persia"
"the long corinthian war finally ended with the peace of antalcidas or the king's peace, in which the ""great king"" of persia, artaxerxes ii, pronounced a ""treaty"" of peace between the various city-states of greece which broke up all ""leagues"" of city-states on greek mainland and in the islands of the aegean sea"
"although this was looked upon as ""independence"" for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral ""treaty"" was highly favourable to the interests of the persian empire"
the corinthian war revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in greece
"while athens and sparta fought each other to exhaustion, thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various greek city-states"
"the peace of antalcidas in 387 bc, an edict was promulgated by the persian king, preserving the greek cities of asia minor and cyprus as well as the independence of the greek aegean cities, except for lymnos, imbros and skyros, which were given over to athens"
it dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones
this is an ultimatum that benefited athens only to the extent that athens held onto three islands
"while the ""great king,"" artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, sparta was to act as persia's agent in enforcing the peace"
"to the persians this document is known as the ""king's peace"
""" to the greeks, this document is known as the peace of antalcidas, after the spartan diplomat antalcidas who was sent to persia as negotiator"
sparta had been worried about the developing closer ties between athens and persia
"accordingly, antalcidas was directed to get whatever agreement he could from the ""great king"""
"accordingly, the ""peace of antalcidas"" is not a negotiated peace at all"
"rather it is a surrender to the interests of persia, drafted entirely for its benefit"
"spartan interventionism on the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences"
"in accordance with it, the boeotian league, or boeotian confederacy, was dissolved in 386 bc"
"this confederacy was dominated by thebes, a city hostile to the spartan hegemony"
"sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in epirus and in the north of greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of thebes, the cadmea, after an expedition in the chalcidice and the capture of olynthos"
it was a theban politician who suggested to the spartan general phoibidas that sparta should seize thebes itself
"this act was sharply condemned, though sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by phoibidas"
the spartan attack was successful and thebes was placed under spartan control
"clash with thebes in 378 bc, the reaction to spartan control over thebes was broken by a popular uprising within thebes"
"elsewhere in greece, the reaction against spartan hegemony began when sphodrias, another spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on piraeus"
"although the gates of piraeus were no longer fortified, sphodrias was driven off before piraeus"
"back in sparta, sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the spartan court"
"nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between athens and thebes. sparta would now have to fight them both together"
"athens was trying to recover from its defeat in the peloponnesian war at the hands of sparta's ""navarch"" lysander in the disaster of 404 bc"
the rising spirit of rebellion against sparta also fueled thebes' attempt to restore the former boeotian confederacy
"in boeotia, the theban leaders pelopidas and epaminondas reorganized the theban army and began to free the towns of boeotia from their spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived boeotian league"
pelopidas won a great victory for thebes over a much larger spartan force in the battle of tegyra in 375 bc
theban authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that athens came to mistrust the growing theban power
athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second athenian league
"attention was drawn to growing power of thebes when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, phocis, and, particularly, after thebes razed the city of plataea, a long-standing ally of athens, in 375 bc"
"the destruction of plataea caused athens to negotiate an alliance with sparta against thebes, in that same year"
"in 371, the theban army, led by epaminondas, inflicted a bloody defeat on spartan forces at battle of leuctra"
"sparta lost a large part of its army and 400 of its 2,000 citizen-troops. the battle of leuctra was a watershed in greek history"
epaminondas' victory ended a long history of spartan military prestige and dominance over greece and the period of spartan hegemony was over
"however, spartan hegemony was not replaced by theban, but rather by athenian hegemony"
financing the league it was important to erase the bad memories of the former league
"its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid"
"instead, syntaxeis were used, irregular contributions as and when athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible"
"these contributions were not taken to athens—unlike the 5th century bc system, there was no central exchequer for the league—but to the athenian generals themselves"
"the athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the eisphora"
"they reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the proseiphora, in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors"
this system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy. athenian hegemony halted this league responded to a real and present need
"on the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century bc, with athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league"
alliance with athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained. the main reasons for the eventual failure were structural
"this alliance was only valued out of fear of sparta, which evaporated after sparta's fall in 371 bc, losing the alliance its sole 'raison d'etre'"
"the athenians no longer had the means to fulfill their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies"
"thus, the tyrant of pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity"
"from 360 bc, athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies  decided to secede"
"in 357 bc the revolt against the league spread, and between 357 bc and 355 bc, athens had to face war against its allies—a war whose issue was marked by a decisive intervention by the king of persia in the form of an ultimatum to athens, demanding that athens recognise its allies' independence under threat of persia's sending 200 triremes against athens"
"athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy, thereby weakening itself more and more, and signaling the end of athenian hegemony"
5th century bc boeotian confederacy  this was not thebes' first attempt at hegemony
"it had been the most important city of boeotia and the centre of the previous boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386"
"the 5th-century confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at oxyrhynchus and known as ""the anonyme of thebes"""
thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy
"citizenship was defined according to wealth, and thebes counted 11,000 active citizens"
"the confederacy was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a ""boeotarch"", a certain number of council members, 1,000 hoplites and 100 horsemen"
"from the 5th century bc the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders"
it also had a small fleet that played a part in the peloponnesian war by providing 25 triremes for the spartans
"at the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a ""navarch"""
all this constituted a significant enough force that the spartans were happy to see the boeotian confederacy dissolved by the king's peace
"this dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the thebans  from reforming this confederacy"
"theban reconstruction pelopidas and epaminondas endowed thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of athens, the thebans revived the title of ""boeotarch"" lost in the persian king's peace and—with victory at leuctra and the destruction of spartan power—the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy"
"epaminondas rid the peloponnesus of pro-spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by sparta"
he equally supported the reconstruction of the city of messene thanks to an invasion of laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them messene as a capital
"he decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the peloponnessus, forming an arcadian confederacy"
confrontation between athens and thebes the strength of the boeotian league explains athens' problems with her allies in the second athenian league
epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the athenian league and joining a boeotian maritime league
epaminondas and pelopidas also reformed the army of thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting
"thus, the theban army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other greek states at the battle of leuctra in 371 bc and the battle of mantinea in 362 bc"
sparta also remained an important power in the face of theban strength
"however, some of the cities allied with sparta turned against her, because of thebes"
"in 367 bc, both sparta and athens sent delegates to artaxerxes ii, the great king of persia"
"these delegates sought to have the artaxerxes, once again, declare greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 bc"
"as noted above, this had meant the destruction of the boeotian league in 387 bc"
"sparta and athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar ""kings peace"""
thebes sent pelopidas to argue against them
"the great king was convinced by pelopidas and the theban diplomats that thebes and the boeotian league would be the best agents of persian interests in greece, and, accordingly, did not issue a new ""king's peace"
""" thus, to deal with thebes, athens and sparta were thrown back on their own resources"
"thebes, meanwhile, expanded its influence beyond the bounds of boeotia"
"in 364 bc, pelopidas defeated the alexander of pherae in the battle of cynoscephalae, located in south-eastern thessaly in northern greece"
"however, during the battle, pelopides was killed"
"the confederational framework of sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past"
"such was the case with the cities of tegea and mantinea, which re-allied in the arcadian confederacy"
"the mantineans received the support of the athenians, and the tegeans that of the thebans"
"in 362 bc, epaminondas led a theban army against a coalition of athenian, spartan, elisian, mantinean and achean forces"
battle was joined at mantinea
"the thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for epaminondas died in the battle, stating that ""i bequeath to thebes two daughters, the victory of leuctra and the victory at mantinea"""
"despite the victory at mantinea, in the end, the thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the peloponnesus"
"this event is looked upon as a watershed in greek history. thus, xenophon concludes his history of the greek world at this point, in 362 bc"
the end of this period was even more confused than its beginning
"greece had failed and, according to xenophon, the history of the greek world was no longer intelligible. the idea of hegemony disappeared"
"the idea of hegemony disappeared. from 362 bc onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in greece"
"the spartans were greatly weakened; the athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat sparta and athens but not to be a major power in asia minor"
"other forces also intervened, such as the persian king, who appointed himself arbitrator among the greek cities, with their tacit agreement"
"this situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for them"
"one war led to another, each longer and more bloody than the last, and the cycle could not be broken"
"hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the invasion of laconia in 370 bc"
thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of macedon in 346 bc
"the energetic leadership within macedon began in 359 bc when philip of macedon was made regent for his nephew, amyntas"
"within a short time, philip was acclaimed king as philip ii of macedonia in his own right, with succession of the throne established on his own heirs"
"during his lifetime, philip ii consolidated his rule over macedonia"
this was done by 359 bc and philip began to look toward expanding macedonia's influence abroad
"under philip ii, , macedon expanded into the territory of the paeonians, thracians, and illyrians"
"in 358 bc, philip allied with epirus in its campaign against illyria"
"in 357 bc, philip came into direct conflict with athens when he conquered the thracian port city of amphipolis, a city located at the mouth of the strymon river to the east of macedonia, and a major athenian trading port"
conquering this city allowed philip to subjugate all of thrace
"a year later in 356 bc, the macedonians attacked and conquered the athenian-controlled port city of pydna"
this brought the macedonian threat to athens closer to home to the athenians
"with the start of the phocian war in 356 bc, the great athenian orator and political leader of the ""war party"", demosthenes, became increasingly active in encouraging athens to fight vigorously against philip's expansionist aims"
"in 352 bc, demosthenes gave many speeches against the macedonian threat, declaring philip ii athens' greatest enemy"
"the leader of the athenian ""peace party"" was phocion, who wished to avoid a confrontation that, phocion felt, would be catastrophic for athens"
"despite phocion's attempts to restrain the war party, athens remained at war with macedonia for years following the original declaration of war"
negotiations between athens and philip ii started only in 346 bc
the athenians successfully halted philip's invasion of attica at thermopylae that same year in 352 bc
"however, philip defeated the phocians at the battle of the crocus field"
"the conflict between macedonia and all the city-states of greece came to a head in 338 bc, at the battle of chaeronea"
"the macedonians became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of greece, but also retained more archaic aspects harking back to the palace culture, first at aegae  then at pella, resembling mycenaean culture more than that of the classical city-states"
"militarily, philip recognized the new phalanx style of fighting that had been employed by epaminondas and pelopidas in thebes"
"accordingly, he incorporated this new system into the macedonian army"
philip ii also brought a theban military tutor to macedon to instruct the future alexander the great in the theban method of fighting
"philip's son alexander the great was born in pella, macedonia . philip ii brought aristotle to pella to teach the young alexander"
"besides alexander's mother, olympias, philip took another wife by the name of cleopatra eurydice"
"cleopatra had a daughter, europa, and a son, caranus. caranus posed a threat to the succession of alexander"
"cleopatra eurydice was a macedonian and, thus, caranus was all macedonian in blood"
"olympias, on the other hand, was from epirus and, thus, alexander was regarded as being only half-macedonian"
philip ii was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter cleopatra of macedon with king alexander i of epirus in 336 bc
"philip's son, the future alexander the great, immediately claimed the throne of macedonia by eliminating all the other claimants to the throne, including caranus and his cousin amytas"
"alexander was only twenty years of age when he assumed the throne.thereafter, alexander continued his father's plans to conquer all of greece"
"he did this by both military might and persuasion. after his victory over thebes, alexander traveled to athens to meet the public directly"
"despite demosthenes' speeches against the macedonian threat on behalf of the war party of athens, the public in athens was still very much divided between the ""peace party"" and demosthenes' ""war party"
""" however, the arrival of alexander charmed the athenian public"
the peace party was strengthened and then a peace between athens and macedonia was agreed
"this allowed alexander to move on his and the greeks' long-held dream of conquest in the east, with a unified and secure greek state at his back"
"in 334 bc, alexander with about 30,000 infantry soldiers and 5,000 cavalry crossed the hellespont into asia"
"shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock formed from mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals 4) and tiny fragments  of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite"
shale is characterized by its tendency to split into thin layers  less than one centimeter in thickness. this property is called fissility
this property is called fissility. shale is the most common sedimentary rock
"the term shale is sometimes applied more broadly, as essentially a synonym for mudrock, rather than in the more narrow sense of clay-rich fissile mudrock"
shale typically exhibits varying degrees of fissility
"because of the parallel orientation of clay mineral flakes in shale, it breaks into thin layers, often splintery and usually parallel to the otherwise indistinguishable bedding planes"
non-fissile rocks of similar composition and particle size  are described as mudstones  or claystones
rocks with similar particle sizes but with less clay  and therefore grittier are siltstones
shales are typically gray in color and are composed of clay minerals and quartz grains
the addition of variable amounts of minor constituents alters the color of the rock
"red, brown and green colors are indicative of ferric oxide , iron hydroxide , or micaceous minerals"
the color shifts from reddish to greenish as iron in the oxidized  state is converted to iron in the reduced  state
black shale results from the presence of greater than one percent carbonaceous material and indicates a reducing environment
pale blue to blue-green shales typically are rich in carbonate minerals.clays are the major constituent of shales and other mudrocks
"the clay minerals represented are largely kaolinite, montmorillonite and illite"
"clay minerals of late tertiary mudstones are expandable smectites, whereas in older rocks  illites predominate"
"the transformation of smectite to illite produces silica, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and water"
"these released elements form authigenic quartz, chert, calcite, dolomite, ankerite, hematite and albite, all trace to minor  minerals found in shales and other mudrocks"
"a typical shale is composed of about 58% clay minerals, 28% quartz, 6% feldspar, 5% carbonate minerals, and 2% iron oxides"
most of the quartz is detrital  rather than authigenic
shales and other mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks
"however, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale"
"black shales, which form in anoxic conditions, contain reduced free carbon along with ferrous iron  and sulfur"
"amorphous iron sulfide, along with carbon, produce the black coloration"
"because amorphous iron sulfide gradually converts to pyrite, which is not an important pigment, young shales may be quite dark from their iron sulfide content, in spite of a modest carbon content , while a black color in an ancient shale indicates a high carbon content"
"most shales are marine in origin, and the groundwater in shale formations is often highly saline"
"there is evidence that shale acts as a semipermeable medium, allowing water to pass through while retaining dissolved salts"
the fine particles that compose shale can remain suspended in water long after the larger particles of sand have been deposited
"as a result, shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits, in river deltas, on floodplains and offshore below the wave base"
thick deposits of shale are found near ancient continental margins and foreland basins
some of the most widespread shale formations were deposited by epicontinental seas
"black shales are common in cretaceous strata on the margins of the atlantic ocean, where they were deposited in fault-bounded silled basins associated with the opening of the atlantic during the breakup of pangea"
"these basins were anoxic, in part because of restricted circulation in the narrow atlantic, and in part because the very warm cretaceous seas lacked the circulation of cold bottom water that oxygenates the deep oceans today"
"most clay must be deposited as aggregates and floccules, since the settling rate of individual clay particles is extremely slow"
flocculation is very rapid once the clay encounters highly saline sea water
"whereas individual clay particles are less than 4 microns in size, the clumps of clay particles produced by flocculation vary in size from a few tens of microns to over 700 microns in diameter"
"the floccules start out water-rich, but much of the water is expelled from the floccules as the clay minerals bind more tightly together over time"
clay pelletization by organisms that filter feed is important where flocculation is inhibited
filter feeders produce an estimated 12 metric tons of clay pellets per square kilometer per year along the u.s. gulf coast
"s. gulf coast.as sediments continue to accumulate, the older, more deeply buried sediments begin to undergo diagenesis"
this mostly consists of compaction and lithification of the clay and silt particles
"early stages of diagenesis, described as eogenesis, take place at shallow depths  and are characterized by bioturbation and mineralogical changes in the sediments, with only slight compaction"
pyrite may be formed in anoxic mud at this stage of diagenesis
"deeper burial is accompanied by mesogenesis, during which most of the compaction and lithification takes place"
"as the sediments come under increasing pressure from overlying sediments, sediment grains move into more compact arrangements, ductile grains  are deformed, and pore space is reduced"
"in addition to this physical compaction, chemical compaction may take place via pressure solution"
"points of contact between grains are under the greatest strain, and the strained mineral is more soluble than the rest of the grain"
"as a result, the contact points are dissolved away, allowing the grains to come into closer contact"
"it is during compaction that shale develops its fissility, likely through mechanical compaction of the original open framework of clay particles"
the particles become strongly oriented into parallel layers that give the shale its distinctive fabric
"fissility likely develops early in the compaction process, at relatively shallow depth, since fissility does not seem to vary with depth in thick formations"
"kaolinite flakes have less tendency to align in parallel layers than other clays, so kaolinite-rich clay is more likely to form nonfissile mudstone than shale"
"on the other hand, black shales often have very pronounced fissility  due to binding of hydrocarbon molecules to the faces of the clay particles, which weakens the binding between particles"
"lithification follows closely on compaction, as increased temperatures at depth hasten deposition of cement that binds the grains together"
"pressure solution contributes to cementing, as the mineral dissolved from strained contact points is redeposited in the unstrained pore spaces"
the clay minerals may be altered as well
"for example, smectite is altered to illite at temperatures of about 55 to 200 °c , releasing water in the process"
other alteration reactions include the alteration of smectite to chlorite and of kaolinite to illite at temperatures between 120 and 150 °c
"because of these reactions, illite composes 80% of precambrian shales, versus about 25% of young shales"
"unroofing of buried shale is accompanied by telogenesis, the third and final stage of diagenesis"
"as erosion reduces the depth of burial, renewed exposure to meteoric water produces additional changes to the shale, such as dissolution of some of the cement to produce secondary porosity"
"pyrite may be oxidized to produce gypsum. black shales are dark, as a result of being especially rich in unoxidized carbon"
"common in some paleozoic and mesozoic strata, black shales were deposited in anoxic, reducing environments, such as in stagnant water columns"
"some black shales contain abundant heavy metals such as molybdenum, uranium, vanadium, and zinc"
"the enriched values are of controversial origin, having been alternatively attributed to input from hydrothermal fluids during or after sedimentation or to slow accumulation from sea water over long periods of sedimentation"
"fossils, animal tracks or burrows and even raindrop impressions are sometimes preserved on shale bedding surfaces"
"shales may also contain concretions consisting of pyrite, apatite, or various carbonate minerals"
"shales that are subject to heat and pressure of metamorphism alter into a hard, fissile, metamorphic rock known as slate"
"with continued increase in metamorphic grade the sequence is phyllite, then schist and finally gneiss"
shale is the most common source rock for hydrocarbons
the lack of coarse sediments in most shale beds reflects the absence of strong currents in the waters of the depositional basin
these might have oxygenated the waters and destroyed organic matter before it could accumulate
"the absence of carbonate rock in shale beds reflects the absence of organisms that might have secreted carbonate skeletons, also likely due to an anoxic environment"
"as a result, about 95% of organic matter in sedimentary rocks is found in shales and other mudrocks"
"individual shale beds typically have an organic matter content of about 1%, but the richest source rocks may contain as much as 40% organic matter"
"the organic matter in shale is converted over time from the original proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and other organic molecules to kerogen, which at the higher temperatures found at greater depths of burial is further converted to graphite and petroleum"
the economy of ancient greece was defined largely by the region's dependence on imported goods
"as a result of the poor quality of greece's soil, agricultural trade was of particular importance"
"the impact of limited crop production was somewhat offset by greece's paramount location, as its position in the mediterranean gave its provinces control over some of egypt's most crucial seaports and trade routes"
"beginning in the 6th century bc, trade craftsmanship and commerce, principally maritime, became pivotal aspects of greek economic output"
"greek soil has been likened to ""stinginess"" or ""tightness""  which helps explain greek colonialism and the importance of the cleruchies of asia minor in controlling the supply of wheat"
"the olive tree and grapevine, as well as orchards, were complemented by the cultivation of herbs, vegetables, and oil-producing plants"
husbandry was badly developed due to a lack of available land
"sheep and goats were the most common types of livestock, while bees were kept to produce honey, the only source of sugar known to the ancient greeks"
up to 80% of the greek population were employed in the agricultural industry
"agricultural work followed the rhythm of the seasons: harvesting olives and trimming grapevines at the beginning of autumn and the end of winter; setting aside fallow land in the spring; harvesting cereals in the summer; cutting wood, sowing seeds, and harvesting grapes in autumn"
"balls the 7th century bc, demographic expansion and the distribution of successions created tensions between these landowners and the peasants"
"in athens, this was changed by solon's reforms, which eliminated debt bondage and protected the peasantry"
"nonetheless, a greek aristocrat's domains remained small compared with the roman latifundia"
much of the craftsmanship of ancient greece was part of the domestic sphere
"however, the situation gradually changed between the 8th and 4th centuries bc, with the increased commercialization of the greek economy"
"thus, weaving and baking, activities so important to the western late medieval economy, were done only by women before the 6th century bc"
"after the growth of commerce, slaves started to be used widely in workshops"
"only fine dyed tissues, like those made with tyrian purple, were created in workshops"
"on the other hand, working with metal, leather, wood, or clay was a specialized activity that was looked down upon by most greeks"
"the basic workshop was often family-operated. lysias's shield manufacture employed 350 slaves; demosthenes' father, a maker of swords, used 32"
"after the death of pericles in 429 bc, a new class emerged: that of the wealthy owners and managers of workshops"
"examples include cleon and anytus, noted tannery owners, and kleophon, whose factory produced lyres"
non-slave workers were paid by assignment since the workshops could not guarantee regular work
"in athens, those who worked on state projects were paid one drachma per day, no matter what craft they practised"
the workday generally began at sunrise and ended in the afternoon
"the potter's work consisted of selecting the clay, fashioning the vase, drying and painting and baking it, and then applying varnish"
"part of the production went to domestic usage  or for commercial purposes, and the rest served religious or artistic functions"
techniques for working with clay have been known since the bronze age; the potter's wheel is a very ancient invention
the ancient greeks did not add any innovations to these processes
the creation of artistically decorated vases in greece had strong foreign influences
"for instance, the famed black-figure style of corinthian potters was most likely derived from the syrian style of metalworking"
"the heights to which the greeks brought the art of ceramics is, therefore, due entirely to their artistic sensibilities and not to technical ingenuity"
pottery in ancient greece was most often the work of slaves
"many of the potters of athens assembled between the agora and the dipylon, in the kerameikon"
"they most often operated as small workshops, consisting of a master, several paid artisans, and slaves"
"greece's main exports were olive oil, wine, pottery, and metalwork"
"imports included grains and pork from sicily, arabia, egypt, ancient carthage, and the bosporan kingdom"
the main participants in greek commerce were the class of traders known as emporoi . the state collected a duty on their cargo
"the state collected a duty on their cargo. at piraeus , this tax was set initially at 1% or higher"
"by the end of the 5th century, the tax had been raised to 33 talents"
"in 413, athens ended the collection of tribute from the delian league and imposed a 5% duty on all the ports of her empire  in the hope of increasing revenues"
"these duties were never protectionist, but were merely intended to raise money for the public treasury"
the growth of trade in greece led to the development of financial techniques
"most merchants, lacking sufficient cash assets, resorted to borrowing to finance all or part of their expeditions"
"a typical loan for a large venture in 4th century bc athens, was generally a large sum of cash , lent for a short time , at a high rate of interest"
"the terms of the contract were always laid out in writing, differing from loans between friends"
"the lender bore all the risks of the journey, in exchange for which the borrower committed his cargo and his entire fleet, which were precautionarily seized upon their arrival at the port of piraeus"
trade in ancient greece was free: the state controlled only the supply of grain
"in athens, following the first meeting of the new prytaneis, trade regulations were reviewed, with a specialized committee overseeing the trade in wheat, flour, and bread"
one of the main drivers of trade in ancient greece was colonization
"as larger city states set up colonies, there would be trade between the founding city and its colony"
"furthermore, differing climates between cities and their respective colonies created comparative advantages in goods"
"for example, colonies in sicily would often have better weather and be able to export grain to more populous cities"
"larger city states often exported more value added goods, such as olive oil, back out to colonies"
the number of shipwrecks found in the mediterranean sea provides valuable evidence of the development of trade in the ancient world
only two shipwrecks were found that dated from the 8th century bc
"however, archaeologists have found forty-six shipwrecks dated from the 4th century bc, which would appear to indicate that there occurred a very large increase in the volume of trade between these centuries"
"considering that the average ship tonnage also increased in the same period, the total volume of trade increased probably by a factor of 30"
"while peasants and artisans often sold their wares, there were also retail merchants known as kápêloi"
"grouped into guilds, they sold fish, olive oil, and vegetables. women sold perfume or ribbons"
women sold perfume or ribbons. merchants were required to pay a fee for their space in the marketplace
"they were viewed poorly by the general population, and aristotle labelled their activities as: ""a kind of exchange which is justly censured, for it is unnatural, and a mode by which men gain from one another"
"""parallel to the ""professional"" merchants were those who sold the surplus of their household products such as vegetables, olive oil, or bread"
"this was the case for many of the small-scale farmers of attica. among townsfolk, this task often fell to the women"
"for instance, euripides' mother sold chervil from her garden . direct taxation was not well-developed in ancient greece"
"the eisphorá  was a tax on the wealth of the very rich, but it was levied only when needed — usually in times of war"
large fortunes were also subject to liturgies which was the support of public works
"liturgies could consist of, for instance, the maintenance of a trireme, a chorus during a theatre festival, or a gymnasium"
"in some cases, the prestige of the undertaking attracted volunteers"
"such was the case for the choragus, who organized and financed choruses for a drama festival"
"in other instances, like the burden of outfitting and commanding a trireme, the liturgy functioned more like a mandatory donation , with the prestige of such a position and other elites' social pressure reducing noncompliance"
"in some cities, like miletus and teos, heavy taxation was imposed on citizens"
"the eisphora was a progressive tax, as it was applied to only the wealthiest"
"the citizens had the ability to reject the taxation, if they believed there was someone else who was wealthier not being taxed"
"the wealthier would have to pay the liturgy.on the other hand, indirect taxes were quite important"
"taxes were levied on houses, slaves, herds and flocks, wines, and hay, among other things"
"the right to collect many of these taxes was often transferred to publicans, or telônai . however, this was not true of all cities"
"however, this was not true of all cities. thasos' gold mines and athens' taxes on business allowed them to eliminate these indirect taxes"
subjugated groups such as the penestae of thessaly and the helots of sparta were taxed by the city-states in which they resided
coinage probably began in lydia around the cities of asia minor under its control
early electrum coins have been found at the temple of diana at ephesus
"the technique of minting coins arrived in mainland greece around 550 bc, beginning with coastal trading cities like aegina and athens"
their use spread and the city-states quickly secured a monopoly on their creation
"the very first coins were made from electrum , followed by pure silver, the most commonly found valuable metal in the region"
the mines of the pangaeon hills allowed the cities of thrace and macedon to mint a large number of coins
"laurium's silver mines provided the raw materials for the ""athenian owls"", the most famous coins of the ancient greek world"
less-valuable bronze coins appeared at the end of the 5th century. coins played several roles in the greek world
"they provided a medium of exchange, mostly used by city-states to hire mercenaries and compensate citizens"
they were also a source of revenue as foreigners had to change their money into the local currency at an exchange rate favourable to the state
"they served as a mobile form of metal resources, which explains discoveries of athenian coins with high levels of silver at great distances from their home city"
"finally, the minting of coins lent an air of undeniable prestige to any greek city or city-state"
"the shopping centres in ancient greece were called agoras. the literal meaning of the word is ""gathering place"" or ""assembly"""
"the agora was the centre of the athletic, artistic, spiritual and political life of the city. the ancient agora of athens was the best-known example"
"early in greek history , free-born citizens would gather in the agora for military duty or to hear statements of the ruling king or council"
"every city had its agora where merchants could sell their products. there was linen from egypt, ivory from africa, spices from syria, and more"
"prices were rarely fixed, so bargaining was a common practice.archaic greece was the period in greek history lasting from c"
"800 bc to the second persian invasion of greece in 480 bc, following the greek dark ages and succeeded by the classical period"
"in the archaic period, greeks settled across the mediterranean and the black seas, as far as marseille in the west and trapezus  in the east; and by the end of the archaic period, they were part of a trade network that spanned the entire mediterranean"
the archaic period began with a massive increase in the greek population and of significant changes that rendered the greek world at the end of the 8th century entirely unrecognizable from its beginning
"according to anthony snodgrass, the archaic period was bounded by two revolutions in the greek world"
"it began with a ""structural revolution"" that ""drew the political map of the greek world"" and established the poleis, the distinctively greek city-states, and it ended with the intellectual revolution of the classical period"
"the archaic period saw developments in greek politics, economics, international relations, warfare and culture"
"it laid the groundwork for the classical period, both politically and culturally"
"it was in the archaic period that the greek alphabet developed, the earliest surviving greek literature was composed, monumental sculpture and red-figure pottery began in greece and the hoplite became the core of greek armies"
"in athens, the earliest institutions of democracy were implemented under solon, and the reforms of cleisthenes at the end of the archaic period brought in athenian democracy as it was during the classical period"
"in sparta, many of the institutions credited to the reforms of lycurgus were introduced during the archaic period, the region of messenia was brought under spartan control, helotage was introduced and the peloponnesian league was founded and made sparta a dominant power in greece"
"the word archaic derives from the greek word archaios, meaning 'old', and refers to the period in ancient greek history before the classical period"
"the archaic period is generally considered to have lasted from the beginning of the 8th century bc until the beginning of the 5th century bc, with the foundation of the olympic games in 776 bc and the second persian invasion of greece in 480 bc forming notional starting and ending dates"
the archaic period was long considered to have been less important and historically interesting than the classical period and was studied primarily as a precursor to it
"more recently, archaic greece has come to be studied for its own achievements"
"with this reassessment of the significance of the archaic period, some scholars have objected to the term archaic because of its connotations in english of being primitive and outdated"
"no term which has been suggested to replace it has gained widespread currency, however, and the term is still in use"
"much evidence about the classical period of ancient greece comes from written histories, such as thucydides's history of the peloponnesian war"
"by contrast, no such evidence survives from the archaic period"
surviving contemporary written accounts of life in the period are in the form of poetry
"other written sources from the archaic period include epigraphical evidence, including parts of law codes, inscriptions on votive offerings and epigrams inscribed on tombs"
"however, none of that evidence is in the quantity for which it survives from the classical period"
what is lacking in written evidence is made up for in the rich archaeological evidence from the archaic greek world
"indeed, although much knowledge of classical greek art comes from later roman copies, all surviving archaic greek art is original"
other sources for the archaic period are the traditions recorded by later greek writers such as herodotus
"however, those traditions are not part of any form of history that would be recognised today"
those transmitted by herodotus were recorded whether or not he believed them to be accurate
"indeed, herodotus did not even record any dates before 480 bc"
"politically, the archaic period saw the development of the polis  as the predominant unit of political organisation"
"many cities throughout greece came under the rule of autocratic leaders, called ""tyrants"""
"it also saw the development of law and systems of communal decision-making, with the earliest evidence for law codes and constitutional structures dating to the period"
"by the end of the archaic period, both the athenian and spartan constitutions seem to have developed into their classical forms"
the archaic period saw significant urbanisation and the development of the concept of the polis as it was used in classical greece
"by solon's time, if not before, the word polis had acquired its classical meaning, and though the emergence of the polis as a political community was still in progress at this point, the polis as an urban centre was a product of the eighth century"
"however, the polis did not become the dominant form of socio-political organisation throughout greece in the archaic period, and in the north and west of the country it did not become dominant until some way into the classical period"
"the urbanisation process in archaic greece known as ""synoecism"" – the amalgamation of several small settlements into a single urban centre – took place in much of greece in the eighth century bc"
"both athens and argos, for instance, began to coalesce into single settlements around the end of that century"
"in some settlements, this physical unification was marked by the construction of defensive city walls, as was the case in smyrna by the middle of the eighth century bc, and corinth by the middle of the seventh century bc"
"it seems that the evolution of the polis as a socio-political structure, rather than a simply geographical one, can be attributed to this urbanisation, as well as a significant population increase in the eighth century"
"these two factors created a need for a new form of political organisation, as the political systems in place at the beginning of the archaic period quickly became unworkable"
"athens though in the early part of the classical period the city of athens was both culturally and politically dominant, it was not until the late sixth century bc that it became a leading power in greece"
"the attempted coup by cylon of athens  may be the earliest event in athenian history which is clearly attested by ancient sources, dating to around 636 bce"
"at this time, it seems that athens' monarchy had already ended and the archonship had replaced it as the most important executive office in the state, though the archonship could only be held by members of the eupatridae, the families which made up athens' aristocracy"
"the earliest laws of athens were established by draco, in 621/0; his law on homicide was the only one to have survived to the classical period"
draco's law code aimed to replace private revenge as the first and only response of an individual to an offence committed against them
"the law code of draco, however, failed to prevent the tensions between the rich and poor which were the impetus to solon's reforms"
"in 594/3 bc, solon was appointed ""archon and mediator"". exactly what his reforms consisted of is uncertain"
"he claimed to have taken up the horoi to set the land free, but the exact meaning of horoi is unknown; their removal seems to have been part of the problem of hektemoroi – another word whose meaning is obscure"
"solon was also credited with abolishing slavery for debtors, and establishing limits on who could be granted athenian citizenship"
"solon instituted radical constitutional reform, replacing noble birth as a qualification for office with income"
"the poorest – called thetes – could hold no offices, although they could attend the assembly and the law courts, while the richest class – the pentacosiomedimni – were the only people eligible to become treasurer, and possibly archon"
"he set up the council of the four hundred, responsible for discussing motions which were to come before the assembly"
"finally, solon substantially reduced the powers of the archon by giving citizens the right of appeal; their case was judged by the assembly"
a second wave of constitutional reform in athens was instituted by cleisthenes towards the end of the sixth century
"cleisthenes apparently redivided the athenian population, which had previously been grouped into four tribes, into ten new tribes"
"a new council of 500 was instituted, with members from each deme represented"
demes were also given the power to determine their own members  and to somewhat determine their own judicial arrangements
these reforms gave the citizen body a sense of responsibility for what happened in the community for the first time
"between the reforms of solon and cleisthenes, the athenian constitution had become identifiably democratic"
sparta sparta's constitution took on the form it would have in the classical period during the eighth century bc
"by the classical period, spartan tradition attributed this constitution to lycurgus of sparta, who according to thucydides lived a little over four centuries before the end of the peloponnesian war, around the end of the ninth century"
"the first messenian war, probably taking place from approximately 740 to 720 bc, saw the strengthening of the powers of the gerousia against the assembly, and the enslavement of the messenian population as helots"
"around the same time, the ephors gained the power to restrict the actions of the kings of sparta"
"thus by the late seventh century, sparta's constitution had recognisably taken on its classical form"
"from around 560 bc, sparta began to build a series of alliances with other greek states, which became the peloponnesian league: by 550, cities such as elis, corinth, and megara were part of the alliance"
"this series of alliances had the dual purpose of preventing the cities of the league from supporting the helot population of messenia, and of helping sparta in its conflict with argos, which in the archaic period was along with sparta one of the major powers in the peloponnese"
"in the eighth and seventh centuries bc, greeks began to spread across the mediterranean, the sea of marmara and the black sea"
"this was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements"
"these greek colonies were not, as roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right"
"greeks settled outside of greece in two distinct ways. the first was in permanent settlements founded by greeks, which formed as independent poleis"
the second form was in what historians refer to as emporia; trading posts which were occupied by both greeks and non-greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods
examples of this latter type of settlement are found at al mina in the east and pithekoussai in the west.the earliest greek colonies were on sicily
"many of these were founded by people from chalcis, but other greek states, such as corinth and megara were also responsible for early colonies in the area"
"by the end of the eighth century bc, greek settlements in southern italy were also well established"
"in the seventh century, greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled. in the west, colonies were founded as far afield as marseilles"
"in the east, the north aegean, the sea of marmara, and the black sea all saw colonies founded. the dominant coloniser in these parts was miletus"
"at the same time, early colonies such as syracuse and megara hyblaea began to themselves establish colonies"
"in the west, sicily and southern italy were some of the largest recipients of greek colonisers"
"so many greek settlements were founded in southern italy that it was known in antiquity as magna graecia – ""great greece"""
"in the last quarter of the eighth century, new greek settlements were founded in sicily and southern italy at an average rate of one every other year, and greek colonists continued to found cities in italy until the mid-fifth century bc"
"archaic greece from the mid-seventh century bc has sometimes been called an ""age of tyrants"""
"the word τύραννος  first appeared in greek literature in a poem of archilochus, to describe the lydian ruler gyges"
"the earliest greek tyrant was cypselus, who seized power in corinth in a coup in 655 bc"
"he was followed by a series of others in the mid-seventh century bc, such as orthagoras in sicyon and theagenes in megara"
various explanations have been provided for the rise of tyranny in the seventh century bc
"the most popular of these explanations dates back to aristotle, who argued that tyrants were set up by the people in response to the nobility becoming less tolerable"
"as there is no evidence from the time that the nobility were becoming increasingly arrogant during the period, modern explanations of seventh century tyranny have tried to find other reasons for unrest among the people"
"for example, robert drews argues that tyrannies were set up by individuals who controlled private armies and that early tyrants did not need the support of the people at all, whilst n"
g.l
"hammond suggests that tyrannies were established as a consequence of in-fighting between rival oligarchs, rather than between the oligarchs and the people"
"recently historians have begun to question the existence of a seventh century ""age of tyrants"""
"in the archaic period, the greek word tyrannos, according to victor parker, did not have the negative connotations it had gained by the time aristotle wrote his constitution of the athenians"
"when archilochus used the word tyrant, it was synonymous with anax"
"parker dates the first use of the word tyrannos in a negative context to the first half of the sixth century, at least fifty years after cypselus took power in corinth"
it was not until the time of thucydides that tyrannos and basileus  were consistently distinguished
"similarly, greg anderson has argued that archaic greek tyrants were not considered illegitimate rulers, and cannot be distinguished from any other rulers of the same period"
"the greek population doubled during the eighth century, resulting in more and larger settlements than previously"
"the largest settlements, such as athens and knossos, might have had populations of 1,500 in 1000 bc; by 700 they might have held as many as 5,000 people"
"this was part of a wider phenomenon of population growth across the mediterranean region at this time, which may have been caused by a climatic shift that took place between 850 and 750, which made the region cooler and wetter"
this led to the expansion of population into uncultivated areas of greece and was probably also a driver for colonisation abroad
"ancient sources give us little information on mortality rates in archaic greece, but it is likely that not many more than half of the population survived to the age of 18: perinatal and infant mortality are likely to have been very high"
the population of archaic greece would have consequently been very young – somewhere between two-fifths and two-thirds of the population might have been under 18
"by contrast, probably less than one in four people were over 40, and only one in 20 over the age of 60"
"evidence from human remains shows that the average age at death increased over the archaic period, but there is no clear trend for other measures of health"
"the size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45–50 m2, but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality"
"from the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average, and by the end of the archaic period the average house size had risen to about 125 m2"
not all arable land in greece was yet under cultivation in the archaic period
"farms appear to have been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements"
"they were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster"
"crop rotation was practiced, with fields left fallow every other year"
"though wheat was preferred, in some parts of greece barley was the staple grain; where wheat was grown it was durum rather than bread wheat"
"alongside these, farmers cultivated pulses, vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables"
"olives and grapes, which could be turned into oil and wine respectively, served as cash crops; farmers who cultivated land near population centres could also sell soft fruits and leafy vegetables at market"
livestock were of secondary importance
"sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth"
a team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly but were expensive to maintain
"as they had in the dark ages, the wealthiest members of greek society could own large herds of cattle"
this pattern had probably developed before the beginning of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it
the idea that it was preceded by a period of pastoralism and that agriculture only became dominant in the course of the archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence
"no technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure"
"the main source for the practice of agriculture in the period is hesiod's works and days, which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; close reading reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves , and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm"
"slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as sharecroppers , or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of workers available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife"
"by the late eighth century bc, the archaic greek world had become involved in an active trade network around the aegean"
it was this trade network that was the source of the orientalizing influence on greek art in the early part of the archaic period
"meanwhile, to the west, trade between corinth and magna graecia in southern italy and sicily was booming"
"the eastern trade mainly involved the greek islands, with aegina, for instance, acting as an intermediary between the east and the greek mainland"
east greek states would go on to become extremely prosperous through the sixth century due to the trade with asia and egypt
"of the mainland cities, those on the coast were the biggest recipients of trade from the east, especially corinth"
"in the early part of the archaic period, athens does not seem to have been particularly actively involved in this eastern trade, and very few examples of eastern imports have been found in athens from the eighth or early seventh centuries"
"by contrast, nearby euboea had trade-links with the east as early as the first half of the eighth century, and the earliest pottery from the greek islands found at al mina in modern syria is from euboea"
"by the sixth century, greece was part of a trade network spanning the entire mediterranean"
"sixth century laconian pottery has been found as far afield as marseilles and carthage to the west, crete to the south and sardis to the east"
"at the beginning of the archaic period, coinage had not yet been invented"
"the greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as units of account"
"as in the near east, precious metal bullion was used as a medium of exchange, principally gold at first, but mainly silver by the beginning of the sixth century"
"the weight of this bullion  was measured using standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits  and handfuls  of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for greek coin denominations"
coinage was invented in lydia around 650 bc
"it was quickly adopted by greek communities in western asia minor, although the older system of bullion remained in use as well"
"the island of aegina began to issue its distinctive ""turtle"" coins before 550 bc, and from there coinage spread to athens, corinth and the cycladic islands in the 540s bc, southern italy and sicily before 525 bc, and thrace before 514 bc"
"most of these coinages were very small and were mostly only used within the community that issued them, but the ""turtles"" of aegina  and the ""owls"" of athens  were issued in great quantity and exported throughout the greek world"
"the images on coins initially changed rapidly, but increasingly each community settled on a single image or set of images"
"some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name, but in many cases their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason"
"the reasons for the rapid and widespread adoption of coinage by the greeks are not entirely clear and several possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, have been suggested"
one possibility is the increased ease of commerce which coinage allowed
"coins were of standardised weights, which meant that their value could be determined without weighing them"
"furthermore, it was not necessary for users of coinage to spend time determining whether the silver was pure silver; the fact that the coin had been issued by the community was a promise that it was worth a set value"
"another possibility is that coinage was adopted specifically to enable communities to make payments to their citizens, mercenaries and artisans in a transparent, fair and efficient way"
"similarly, when wealthy members of the community were required to contribute wealth to the community for festivals and the equipment of navies, coinage made the process more efficient and transparent"
"a third possibility, that coinage was adopted as an expression of a community's independence and identity, seems to be anachronistic"
"in the visual arts, the archaic period is characterised by a shift towards representational and naturalistic styles"
"it was the period in which monumental sculpture was introduced to greece, and in which greek pottery styles went through great changes, from the repeating patterns of the late geometric period to the earliest red-figure vases"
"the early part of the archaic period saw distinctive orientalizing influences, both in pottery and in sculpture"
"sculpture at the beginning of the archaic period, greek sculpture mostly consisted of small bronze works, particularly of horses"
"bronze human figures were also produced, and both horse and human figures are primarily found in religious sanctuaries"
"towards the end of the eighth century, horse figurines became much less common, disappearing ""almost completely"" by 700 bc"
"in the seventh century, greek sculpture saw a strong eastern influence, with mythical creatures such as griffins and sirens becoming much more popular"
"also in the seventh century bc, greek sculpture began to directly represent gods, a practice which had disappeared after the end of the mycenaean period"
life-size human sculpture in hard stone began in greece in the archaic period
this was inspired in part by ancient egyptian stone sculpture: the proportions of the new york kouros exactly correspond to egyptian rules about the proportion of human figures
"in greece, these sculptures best survive as religious dedications and grave markers, but the same techniques would have also been used to make cult images"
"the best-known types of archaic sculpture are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues of a young man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century bc in the cyclades"
"probably the earliest kore produced was the dedication of nikandre, which was dedicated to artemis at her temple on delos between 660 and 650 bc, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this"
kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities
"some kouroi, such as the colossus of the naxians from around 600 bc, are known to represent apollo, while the phrasikleia kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked"
"over the course of the sixth century, kouroi from attica become more lifelike and naturalistic"
"however, this trend does not appear elsewhere in the greek world"
"the genre began to become less common over the last part of the sixth century as the elites who commissioned kouroi declined in influence, and by around 480 kouroi were no longer made"
pottery the period saw a shift in the decoration of greek pottery from abstract to figurative styles
"during the greek dark ages, following the fall of the mycenaean civilisation, greek pottery decoration had been based around increasingly elaborate geometrical patterns"
"human figures first appeared on greek pots in crete in the early part of the ninth century bc, but did not become common on mainland greek pottery until the middle of the eighth century bc"
"the eighth century saw the development of the orientalizing style, which signalled a shift away from the earlier geometric style and the accumulation of influences derived from phoenicia and syria"
this orientalizing influence seems to have come from goods imported to greece from the near east
"at the beginning of the seventh century bc, vase painters in corinth began to develop the black-figure style"
"at the same time, potters began to use incisions in the clay of vases in order to draw outlines and interior detailing"
"this adoption of incision, probably taken from eastern metalwork, allowed potters to show fine details of their decorations"
"as the archaic period drew to a close, red-figure pottery was invented in athens, with the first examples being produced about 525 bc, probably by the andokides painter"
the invention of the red-figure technique in athens came at around the same time as the development of other techniques such as the white ground technique and six's technique
the earliest extant greek literature comes from the archaic period. poetry was the predominant form of literature in the period
"alongside the dominant lyric and epic traditions, tragedy began to develop in the archaic period, borrowing elements from the pre-existing genres of archaic greek poetry"
by the sixth century bc the first written prose in greek literature appeared
"writing after the end of the mycenaean period, the art of writing was lost in greece: by the ninth century probably no greeks understood the bronze age linear b writing system"
"from the ninth century bc objects inscribed with phoenician writing began to be brought into the greek world, and it was from this phoenician script that the greek alphabet developed in the eighth century bc"
"by the middle of the eighth century bc, pottery inscribed in greek begins to occur in the archaeological record"
the earliest known inscriptions in greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed
"possibly the earliest known greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century bc, discovered in osteria dell'osa in latium"
"most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of ionia's eastern neighbours"
"from the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects, and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties"
"poetry greek literature in the archaic period was predominantly poetry, though the earliest prose dates to the sixth century bc"
"archaic poetry was primarily intended to be performed rather than read, and can be broadly divided into three categories: lyric, rhapsodic, and citharodic"
the performance of the poetry could either be private  or public
"though there would certainly have been a pre-existing literary tradition in greece, the earliest surviving works are by homer"
"homer's poetry, though it dates to around the time that the greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally – the earliest surviving poetry to have certainly been composed in writing is that of archilochus, from the mid-seventh century bc"
"in contrast with the classical period, in which the literary culture of athens dominated the greek world, the archaic poetic tradition was geographically spread out"
"sappho and alcaeus, for instance, were from lesbos, while pindar came from thebes, and alcman from sparta"
"the beginnings of greek tragedy also have their roots in the archaic period, though the exact history is obscure"
the competition in tragedy at the great dionysia began in the 530s bc
"aristotle believed that early tragedy developed from the dithyramb, a choral hymn to dionysius; by ancient tradition the development from dithyramb to tragedy was ascribed to thespis"
evidence from linear b tablets shows that the gods worshipped in archaic and classical greece shared names with those worshipped by their mycenaean predecessors
"however, the practice of religion changed significantly in the archaic period"
"the most significant change of the eighth century was the development of permanent temples as a regular feature of sanctuary sites, where in the dark ages there had probably been no building specifically used for cult purposes"
"in the seventh century, this development of temples continued with the appearance of the first monumental stone temple buildings, beginning with the temple of apollo at corinth"
these temples were probably built to house cult statues of the god
"except on crete, where there may have been a continuous tradition of cult statues from the mycenaean period, these cult images were a new development in greek religion – there is no evidence that greek dark age cult on the mainland used cult images"
along with the introduction of temples came an increase in the number of dedications at cult sites
"in the seventh century, the number of surviving dedications decreases again, but there is also a marked change in the character of dedications, from the figurines of animals common in the eighth century to human figurines"
"in the eighth century, some sanctuaries – for instance at olympia – begin to attract dedications from outside the local area"
"olympia the sanctuary of zeus at olympia had been a cult site in the dark ages, with dedications there dating back to the tenth century bc, but the eighth century saw an explosion in the number of dedications: 160 animal figurines are known from the 9th century, compared to 1,461 from the 8th"
bronze tripods and jewellery have also been discovered as dedications at archaic olympia
"though most of the dedications from the 8th century were manufactured in the peloponnese, dedications also came from attica, and even as far afield as italy and the eastern mediterranean"
this enormous explosion in cultic activity in olympia apparently coincides with the establishment of the olympic games as a major event
"according to greek tradition the first games at olympia had been established by herakles, but these had fallen out of practice until they were revived in 776 bc"
"delphi delphi, on the slopes of mount parnassus, had been continuously occupied from the bronze age, but the first evidence of a sanctuary there dates to the eighth century bc when dedicatory bronze tripods and votive figurines begin to appear in the archaeological record"
"in the last quarter of the eighth century, the number of offerings at delphi significantly increased, and there is evidence that these offerings were beginning to come from across greece"
this pan-hellenic interest in the sanctuary at delphi was presumably driven by the development of the oracle there
"funerary practices the archaic period saw a series of changes in greek funerary practices, with a significant increase in the diversity of greek burial practice"
"in athens, the dark age practice had been to cremate adults and then bury the remains in a pottery vessel, along with pottery and metal grave goods"
"soon after 800 bc, burial superseded cremation as the primary way of disposing of adult bodies, and grave goods declined in both quantity and quality; at the same time, the pots used as grave markers became significantly more elaborate"
"by the last third of the century, children and adults began to be buried together"
grave goods began to be left in trenches specifically for offerings which were separate from the graves themselves
"around 700 bc, athens changed from inhumation back to cremation – but this time, cremation in the grave rather than on a separate pyre"
"also around 700 bc, burial in athens was almost entirely confined to specific cemeteries outside of the settlement"
"other settlements outside of athens also saw a move to burial only in areas reserved for the purpose, though this was not a new development in crete and several aegean islands"
"some other mainland cities, such as argos and corinth, also saw a reduction in grave goods"
"in athens in the sixth century, solon passed laws restricting the extravagance of funerals, and similar restrictions were also implemented at gortyn, mytilene, and sparta"
"the archaic period saw the beginning of philosophical and scientific thinking in greece, and the greeks' interaction with other cultures from italy, egypt, and the near east in this period had a significant impact on their thought"
"in the archaic period, the boundaries between disciplines had not yet developed, and so the thinkers who were later identified as philosophers also engaged in practical pursuits: andrea nightingale describes them as ""pragmatic and polymathic"""

"in the archaic period, the most significant military development was the adoption of hoplite warfare by the greek states"
this occurred in the early part of the seventh century bc
"the panoply, or hoplite's armour, began to appear in the eighth century; the earliest known example comes from argos in the late eighth century"
"though the pieces which made up the panoply were all in use in greece by the end of the eighth century, the earliest evidence for it being worn as a complete set of armour does not come until around 675 bc, where it is depicted on a corinthian vase painting"
