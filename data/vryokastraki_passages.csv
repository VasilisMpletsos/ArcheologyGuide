"the rocky islet, until at least late antiquity, must have been connected to the coast by a narrow isthmus"
the building remains and the finds that came to light attest to the centuries-old use of the island

"the found wall can be dated to the classical or the hellenistic era, even though some parts, especially in the upper town, due to their masonry style, might be archaic"
