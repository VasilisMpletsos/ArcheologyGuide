passages
"at the top of the acropolis, an important sanctuary occupies a dominant position, which, as surface finds show, was in use from the end of the 8th bc up to the 1st ad"
"after excavation in the summer of 2021, the remains of at least 4 buildings came to light (buildings three to six)"
the type of finds led to the safe conclusion that the sanctuary was dedicated to the worship of both demeter and kore
"during the excavation, hundreds of clay archaic-hellenistic figurines were found many of them intact, just as many archaic-roman lamps and mixed ritual vessels"
"the offerings also include some bronze, silver, bone and glass jewelry, marble vessels, and a marble hand that probably holds a torch"
several vessels of probably roman age from the interior of the temple (building four) are identified as ritual as they have inscriptions carved before firing and are dedications by women to demeter and kori
"in the sanctuary, in 2021, four buildings and a retaining wall in the east connecting buildings three and four were revealed"
"building three, twenty one meters long and eight point five meters wide, with trapezoidal masonry and a monumental entrance in the middle of the elongated north wall, dates to the classical period"
"the bilateral building four, measuring seven point five by seven point five meters, is matched with the temple of the classical times"
"three ritual cases of upright stone slabs were found, partially embedded in a layer of ash containing many burnt animal bones"
"western building six is configured internally on at least three stepped levels, probably to serve cult purposes"
"east building five, measuring three point eight by three point eight meters, contained as a filling under its floor many intact lamps from the archaic, classical and hellenistic periods, as well as various votive offerings"
"finally, between the main temple and buildings five and three, a rampart is formed with an entrance from the east, which defined at some point, during the long course of use of the sanctuary (7th century bc to 3rd 4th century ad) a extensive depository containing innumerable votives"
the importance of the sanctuary lies in the close relationship witnessed with the famous sanctuary of demeter in eleusis
"many piglets were in the presence in their place and in the abundance of votive offerings that seem to be related to nightly ceremonies during the thesmophoria, in which women who resided within the sanctuary took part"
two inscriptions from the linked sanctuary of demeter in eleusis dating to 421 bc and 408 bc indicate that the kythnians retained their close links to athens during the last quarter of the 5th century bc
"in ancient greek religion and mythology, demeter  is the olympian goddess of the harvest and agriculture, presiding over crops, grains, food, and the fertility of the earth"
"although she is mostly known as a grain goddess, she also appeared as a goddess of health, birth, and marriage, and had connections to the underworld"
she is also called deo
"in greek tradition, demeter is the second child of the titans rhea and cronus, and sister to hestia, hera, hades, poseidon, and zeus"
"like her other siblings but zeus, she was swallowed by her father as an infant and rescued by zeus"
"through her brother zeus, she became the mother of persephone, a fertility goddess"
"one of the most notable homeric hymns, the homeric hymn to demeter, tells the story of persephone's abduction by hades and demeter's search for her"
"when hades, the king of the underworld, wished to make persephone his wife, he abducted her from a field while she was picking flowers, with zeus' leave"
demeter searched everywhere to find her missing daughter to no avail until she was informed that hades had taken her to the underworld
"in response, demeter neglected her duties as goddess of agriculture, plunging the earth into a deadly famine where nothing would grow, causing mortals to die"
zeus ordered hades to return persephone to her mother to avert the disaster
"however, because persephone had eaten food from the underworld, she could not stay with demeter forever but had to divide the year between her mother and her husband, explaining the seasonal cycle, as demeter does not let plants grow while persephone is gone"
"her cult titles include sito , ""she of the grain"", as the giver of food or grain, and thesmophoros , ""giver of customs"" or ""legislator"", in association with the secret female-only festival called the thesmophoria"
"though demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and death"
"she and her daughter persephone were the central figures of the eleusinian mysteries, a religious tradition that predated the olympian pantheon and which may have its roots in the mycenaean period c"
"1400‚Äì1200 bc.demeter was often considered to be the same figure as the anatolian goddess cybele, and she was identified with the roman goddess ceres"
"demeter may appear in linear a as da-ma-te on three documents , all three dedicated to religious situations and all three bearing just the name"
"it is unlikely that demeter appears as da-ma-te in a linear b  inscription ; the word êÄÖêÄîêÄ≥, da-ma-te, probably refers to ""households"""
"on the other hand, êÄØêÄµêÄ°êÄ¥êÄõêÄä, si-to-po-ti-ni-ja, ""potnia of the grain"", is regarded as referring to her bronze age predecessor or to one of her epithets"
demeter's character as mother-goddess is identified in the second element of her name meter  derived from proto-indo-european  *m√©h‚ÇÇtƒìr
"in antiquity, different explanations were already proffered for the first element of her name"
"it is possible that da , a word which corresponds to gƒì  in attic, is the doric form of de , ""earth"", the old name of the chthonic earth-goddess, and that demeter is ""mother-earth"""
"liddell & scott find this ""improbable"" and beekes writes, ""there is no indication that  means ""earth"", although it has also been assumed in the name of poseidon found in the linear b inscription e-ne-si-da-o-ne, ""earth-shaker"""
"john chadwick also argues that the dƒÅ element in the name of demeter is not so simply equated with ""earth"".m. l"
"west has proposed that the word demeter, initially damater, could be a borrowing from an illyrian deity attested in the messapic goddess damatura, with a form dƒÅ- m-) attached to -matura , akin to the illyrian god dei-paturos"
the lesbian form d≈ç- may simply reflect a different colloquial pronunciation of the non-greek name
"another theory suggests that the element de- might be connected with deo, an epithet of demeter and it could derive from the cretan word dea , ionic zeia ‚Äîvariously identified with emmer, spelt, rye, or other grains by modern scholars‚Äîso that she is the mother and the giver of food generally"
"this view is shared by british scholar jane ellen harrison, who suggests that d√©meter's name means grain-mother, instead of earth-mother. r. s. p"
"r. s. p. beekes rejects a greek interpretation, but not necessarily an indo-european one.wanax  was her male companion  in mycenaean cult"
"the arcadian cult links her to the god poseidon, who probably substituted the male companion of the great goddess; demeter may therefore be related to a minoan great goddess"
"an alternative proto-indo-european etymology comes through potnia and despoina, where des- represents a derivative of pie *dem , and demeter is ""mother of the house"""
"demeter was frequently associated with images of the harvest, including flowers, fruit, and grain"
she was also sometimes pictured with her daughter persephone
"however, demeter is not generally portrayed with any of her consorts; the exception is iasion, the youth of crete who lay with her in a thrice-ploughed field and was killed afterward by a jealous zeus with a thunderbolt"
"demeter is assigned the zodiac constellation virgo, the virgin, by marcus manilius in his 1st-century roman work astronomicon"
"in art, the constellation virgo holds spica, a sheaf of wheat in her hand and sits beside constellation leo the lion"
"in arcadia, she was known as ""black demeter"""
"she was said to have taken the form of a mare to escape the pursuit of her younger brother, poseidon, and having been raped by him despite her disguise, she dressed all in black and retreated into a cave to mourn and to purify herself"
she was consequently depicted with the head of a horse in this region.a sculpture of the black demeter was made by onatas
"in the earliest conceptions of demeter she is the goddess of grain and threshing, however her functions were extended beyond the fields and she was often identified with the earth goddess"
some of the epithets of gaia and demeter are similar showing the identity of their nature
"in most of her myths and cults, demeter is the ""grain-mother"" or the ""earth-mother"
in the older chthonic cults the earth goddess was related to the underworld and in the secret rites  demeter and persephone share the double function of death and fertility
demeter is the giver of the secret rites and the giver of the laws of cereal agriculture
she was occasionally identified with the great mother rheacybele who was worshipped in crete and asia minor with the music of cymbals and violent rites
it seems that poppies were connected with the cult of the great mother
"in epic poetry and hesiod's theogony, demeter is the grain-mother, the goddess of cereals who provides grain for bread and blesses its harvesters"
"in homer's iliad, the blond demeter with the help of the wind separates the grain from the chaff"
homer mentions the thalysia a greek harvest-festival of first fruits in honour of demeter
"in hesiod, prayers to zeus-chthonios  and demeter help the crops grow full and strong"
"this was her main function at eleusis, and she became panhellenic. in cyprus, ""grain-harvesting"" was damatrizein"
"in cyprus, ""grain-harvesting"" was damatrizein. demeter was the zeidoros arŒøura, the homeric ""mother earth arŒøura"" who gave the gift of cereals"
most of the epithets of demeter describe her as a goddess of grain
her name deo in literature probably relates her with deai a cretan word for cereals
in attica she was called haloas  according to the earliest conception of demeter as the corn-mother
she was sometimes called chloe  and sometimes ioulo
"chloe was the goddess of young corn and young vegetation and ""iouloi"" were harvest songs in honour of the goddess"
the reapers called demeter amallophoros  and amaia . the goddess was the giver of abundance of food and she was known as sito  and himalis
the bread from the first harvest-fruits was called thalysian bread  in honour of demeter
"the sacrificial cakes burned on the altar were called ""ompniai"" and in attica the goddess was known as ompnia . these cakes were oferred to all gods"
in some fests big loafs  were oferred to the goddess and in boeotia she was known as megalartos  and megalomazos
"her function was extended to vegetation generally and to all fruits and she had the epithets eukarpos ,karpophoros , malophoros  and sometimes oria"
these epithets show an identity in nature with the earth goddess
"the central theme in the eleusinian mysteries was the reunion of persephone with her mother, demeter when new crops were reunited with the old seed, a form of eternity"
"according to the athenian rhetorician isocrates, demeter's greatest gifts to humankind were agriculture which gave to men a civilized way of life, and the mysteries which give the initiate higher hopes in this life and the afterlife"
these two gifts were intimately connected in demeter's myths and mystery cults
demeter is the giver of mystic rites and the giver of the civilized way of life
"her epithet eleusinia relates her with the eleusinian mysteries, however at sparta eleusinia had an early use, and it was probably a name rather than an epithet"
demeter thesmophoros  is closely associated to the laws of cereal agriculture
the festival thesmophoria was celebrated throughout greece and was connected to a form of agrarian magic
"near pheneus in arcadia she was known as demeter-thesmia , and she received rites according to the local version"
"demeter's emblem is the poppy, a bright red flower that grows among the barley"
"in addition to her role as an agricultural goddess, demeter was often worshipped more generally as a goddess of the earth, from which crops spring up"
her individuality was rooted to the less developed personality of gaia
"in arcadia demeter- melaina  was represented as snake-haired with a horse's head holding a dove and dolphin, perhaps to symbolize her power over the underworld, the air, and the water"
"the cult of demeter in the region was related to despoina, a very old chthonic divinity"
demeter shares the double function of death and fertility with her daughter persephone. demeter and persephone were called despoinai  and demeters
"this duality was also used in the classical period  and particularly in an oath: ""by the two goddesses"""
"in the cult of phlya she was worshipped as anesidora who sends up gifts from the underworld.in sparta, she was known as demeter-chthonia"
"in sparta, she was known as demeter-chthonia . after each death the mourning should end with a sacrifice to the goddess"
"pausanias believes that her cult was introduced from hermione, where demeter was associated with hades"
"in a local legend a hollow in the earth was the entrance to the underworld, by which the souls could pass easily"
"in elis she was called demeter-chamyne , in an old chthonic cult associated with the descent to hades"
"at levadia the goddess was known as demeter-europa and she was associated with trophonius, an old divinity of the underworld"
the oracle of trophonius was famous in the antiquity.pindar uses the rare epithet chalkokrotos
brazen musical instruments were used in the mysteries of demeter and the great-mother rhea-cybele was also worshipped with the music of cymbals
"in central greece demeter was known as amphictyonis , in a cult of the goddess at anthele near thermopylae"
she was the patron goddess of an ancient amphictyony
"thermopylae is the place of hot springs considered to be entrances to hades, since demeter was a chthonic goddess in the older local cults"
"the athenians called the dead ""demetrioi"", and this may reflect a link between demeter and the ancient cult of the dead, linked to the agrarian belief that a new life would sprout from the dead body, as a new plant arises from buried seed"
"this was most likely a belief shared by initiates in demeter's mysteries, as interpreted by pindar: ""blessed is he who has seen before he goes under the earth; for he knows the end of life and knows also its divine beginning"
"""in arcadia demeter had the epithets erinys  and melaina  which are associated with the myth of demeter's rape by poseidon"
"the epithets stress the darker side of her character and her relation to the dark underworld, in an old chthonic cult associated with wooden structures"
erinys had a similar function with the avenging dike . in the mysteries of pheneus the goddess was known as cidaria
"her priest would put on the mask of demeter, which was kept secret"
the cult may have been connected with both the underworld and a form of agrarian magic
theocritus described one of demeter's earlier roles as that of a goddess of poppies: karl ker√©nyi asserted that poppies were connected with a cretan cult which was eventually carried to the eleusinian mysteries in classical greece
"in a clay statuette from gazi, the minoan poppy goddess wears the seed capsules, sources of nourishment and narcosis, in her diadem"
"according to ker√©nyi, ""it seems probable that the great mother goddess who bore the names rhea and demeter, brought the poppy with her from her cretan cult to eleusis and it is almost certain that in the cretan cult sphere opium was prepared from poppies"
""" in an older tradition in crete the vegetation cult was related with the deity of the cave"
"during the bronze age, a goddess of nature dominated both in minoan and mycenean cults"
in the linear b inscriptions po-ti-ni-ja  refers to the goddess of nature who was concerned with birth and vegetation and had certain chthonic apects
some scholars believe that she was the universal mother goddess
a linear b inscription at knossos mentions the potnia of the labyrinth da-pu-ri-to-jo po-ti-ni-ja
"poseidon was often given the title wa-na-ka  in linear b inscriptions in his role as king of the underworld, and his title e-ne-si-da-o-ne indicates his chthonic nature"
he was the male companion  of the goddess in the minoan and propably mycenean cult
"in the cave of amnisos, enesidaon is associated with the cult of eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, who was involved with the annual birth of the divine child"
"elements of this early form of worship survived in the eleusinian cult, where the following words were uttered: ""the mighty potnia had born a strong son"
""" tablets from pylos of c.1400-1200 bc record sacrificial goods destined for ""the two queens and poseidon"""
"the ""two queens"" may be related to demeter and persephone or their precursors, goddesses who were no longer associated with poseidon in later periods"
"in pylos potnia  is the major goddess of the city and ""wanax "" in the tablets has a similar nature with her male consort in the minoan cult"
"potnia retained some chthonic cults, and in popular religion these were related to the goddess demeter"
in greek religion potniai appear in plural  and are closely related to the eleusinian demeter
"major cults to demeter are known at eleusis in attica, hermion , megara, celeae, lerna, aegila, munychia, corinth, delos, priene, akragas, iasos, pergamon, selinus, tegea, thoricus, dion  lykosoura, mesembria, enna, and samothrace"
"probably the earliest amphictyony centred on the cult of demeter at anthele , lay on the coast of malis south of thessaly, near thermopylae"
mysian demeter had a seven-day festival at pellen√© in arcadia
"the geographer pausanias passed the shrine to mysian demeter on the road from mycenae to argos and reports that according to argive tradition, the shrine was founded by an argive named mysius who venerated demeter"
"""saint demetra"" even after theodosius i issued the edict of thessalonica and banned paganism throughout the roman empire, people throughout greece continued to pray to demeter as ""saint demetra"", patron saint of agriculture"
"around 1765‚Äì1766, the antiquary richard chandler, alongside the architect nicholas revett and the painter william pars, visited eleusis and mentioned a statue of a caryatid as well as the folklore that surrounded it, they stated that it was considered sacred by the locals because it protected their crops"
"they called the statue ""saint demetra"", a saint whose story had many similarities to the myth of demeter and persephone, except that her daughter had been abducted by the turks and not by hades"
the locals covered the statue with flowers to ensure the fertility of their fields
"this tradition continued until the 19th century, when the statue was forcibly removed by edward daniel clarke who presented it to the university of cambridge"
demeter's two major festivals were sacred mysteries. her thesmophoria festival  was women-only
her thesmophoria festival  was women-only. her eleusinian mysteries were open to initiates of any gender or social class
at the heart of both festivals were myths concerning demeter as mother and persephone as her daughter
"in the roman period, demeter became conflated with the roman agricultural goddess ceres through interpretatio romana"
"the worship of demeter has formally merged with that of ceres around 205 bc, along with the ritus graecia cereris, a greek-inspired form of cult, as part of rome's general religious recruitment of deities as allies against carthage, towards the end of the second punic war"
"the cult originated in southern italy  and was probably based on the thesmophoria, a mystery cult dedicated to demeter and persephone as ""mother and maiden"""
"it arrived along with its greek priestesses, who were granted roman citizenship so that they could pray to the gods ""with a foreign and external knowledge, but with a domestic and civil intention"""
"the new cult was installed in the already ancient temple of ceres, liber and libera, rome's aventine patrons of the plebs; from the end of the 3rd century bc, demeter's temple at enna, in sicily, was acknowledged as ceres' oldest, most authoritative cult centre, and libera was recognized as proserpina, roman equivalent to persephone"
their joint cult recalls demeter's search for persephone after the latter's abduction into the underworld by hades
"at the aventine, the new cult took its place alongside the old"
"it did not refer to liber, whose open and gender-mixed cult played a central role in plebeian culture as a patron and protector of plebeian rights, freedoms and values"
"the exclusively female initiates and priestesses of the new ""greek style"" mysteries of ceres and proserpina were expected to uphold rome's traditional, patrician-dominated social hierarchy and traditional morality"
"unmarried girls should emulate the chastity of proserpina, the maiden; married women should seek to emulate ceres, the devoted and fruitful mother"
their rites were intended to secure a good harvest and increase the fertility of those who partook in the mysteries
"beginning in the 5th century bce in asia minor, demeter was also considered equivalent to the phrygian goddess cybele"
"demeter's festival of thesmophoria was popular throughout asia minor, and the myth of persephone and adonis in many ways mirrors the myth of cybele and attis"
"some late antique sources syncretized several ""great goddess"" figures into a single deity"
"for example, the platonist philosopher apuleius, writing in the late 2nd century, identified ceres  with isis, having her declare: i, mother of the universe, mistress of all the elements, first-born of the ages, highest of the gods, queen of the shades, first of those who dwell in heaven, representing in one shape all gods and goddesses"
"my will controls the shining heights of heaven, the health-giving sea winds, and the mournful silences of hell; the entire world worships my single godhead in a thousand shapes, with divers rites, and under many a different name"
"the phrygians, first-born of mankind, call me the pessinuntian mother of the gods; ... the ancient eleusinians actaean ceres; .."
".. and the egyptians who excel in ancient learning, honour me with the worship which is truly mine and call me by my true name: queen isis"
"--apuleius, translated by e. j. kenny. the golden ass hesiod's theogony  describes demeter as the second daughter and child of cronus and rhea"
"like her sisters and two of her brothers, she was swallowed as a newborn by her father due to his fear of being overthrown by one of his children; she was freed when her youngest brother zeus made cronus disgorge all his children by giving him a special potion"
"demeter is notable as the mother of persephone, described by both hesiod and in the homeric hymn to demeter as the result of a union with her younger brother zeus"
"an alternate recounting of the matter appears in a fragment of the lost orphic theogony, which preserves part of a myth in which zeus mates with his mother, rhea, in the form of a snake, explaining the origin of the symbol on hermes' staff"
"their daughter is said to be persephone, whom zeus, in turn, mates with to conceive dionysus"
"according to the orphic fragments, ""after becoming the mother of zeus, she who was formerly rhea became demeter"
"""before her abduction by hades, persephone was known as kore , and there is some evidence that the figures of persephone, queen of the underworld and kore, daughter of demeter, were initially considered separate goddesses"
"however, they must have become conflated by the time of hesiod in the 7th century bc"
demeter and persephone were often worshipped together and were often referred to by joint cultic titles
"in their cult at eleusis, they were referred to simply as ""the goddesses"", usually distinguished as ""the older"" and ""the younger""; in rhodes and sparta, they were worshipped as ""the demeters""; in the thesmophoria, they were known as ""the thesmophoroi"""
"in arcadia they were known as ""the great goddesses"" and ""the mistresses"""
"in mycenaean pylos, demeter and persephone were probably called the ""queens"" .both homer and hesiod, writing c"
"700 bc, described demeter making love with the agricultural hero iasion in a ploughed field during the marriage of cadmus and harmonia"
"according to hesiod, this union resulted in the birth of plutus"
"according to diodorus siculus, in his bibliotheca historica written in the 1st century bc, demeter and zeus were also the parents of dionysus"
diodorus described the myth of dionysus' double birth  and once from the vine
"diodorus also related a version of the myth of dionysus' destruction by the titans , who boiled him, and how demeter gathered up his remains so that he could be born a third time"
"diodorus states that dionysus' birth from zeus and his older sister demeter was somewhat of a minority belief, possibly via conflation of demeter with her daughter, as most sources state that the parents of dionysus were zeus and persephone, and later zeus and semele"
"in arcadia, a major arcadian deity known as despoina  was said to be the daughter of demeter and poseidon"
"according to pausanias, a thelpusian tradition said that during demeter's search for persephone, poseidon pursued her"
demeter turned into a horse to avoid her younger brother's advances
"however, he turned into a stallion and mated with the goddess, resulting in the birth of the horse god arion and a daughter ""whose name they are not wont to divulge to the uninitiated"""
"elsewhere, he says that the phigalians assert that the offspring of poseidon and demeter was not a horse, but despoina, ""as the arcadians call her"""
"in orphic literature, demeter seems to be the mother of the witchcraft goddess hecate"
"the goddess took mecon, a young athenian, as a lover; he was at some point transformed into a poppy flower"
"demeter's daughter persephone was abducted to the underworld by hades, who received permission from her father zeus to take her as his bride"
"demeter searched for her ceaselessly for nine days, preoccupied with her grief"
"hecate then approached her and said that while she had not seen what happened to persephone, she heard her screams"
"together the two goddesses went to helios, the sun god, who witnessed everything that happened on earth thanks to his lofty position"
"helios then revealed to demeter that hades had snatched a screaming persephone to make her his wife with the permission of zeus, the girl's father"
demeter then filled with anger. the seasons halted; living things ceased their growth and began to die
"faced with the extinction of all life on earth, zeus sent his messenger hermes to the underworld to bring persephone back"
"hades agreed to release her if she had eaten nothing while in his realm, but persephone had eaten a small number of pomegranate seeds"
"this bound her to hades and the underworld for certain months of every year, most likely the dry mediterranean summer, when plant life is threatened by drought, despite the popular belief that it is autumn or winter"
"there are several variations on the basic myth; the earliest account, the homeric hymn to demeter, relates that persephone is secretly slipped a pomegranate seed by hades and in ovid's version, persephone willingly and secretly eats the pomegranate seeds, thinking to deceive hades, but is discovered and made to stay"
"contrary to popular perception, persephone's time in the underworld does not correspond with the unfruitful seasons of the ancient greek calendar, nor her return to the upper world with springtime"
demeter's descent to retrieve persephone from the underworld is connected to the eleusinian mysteries
the myth of the capture of persephone seems to be pre-greek
"in the greek version, ploutos  represents the wealth of the corn that was stored in underground silos or ceramic jars"
similar subterranean pithoi were used in ancient times for funerary practices
"at the beginning of the autumn, when the corn of the old crop is laid on the fields, she ascends and is reunited with her mother, demeter, for at this time, the old crop and the new meet each other"
"in the orphic tradition, while she was searching for her daughter, a mortal woman named baubo received demeter as her guest and offered her a meal and wine"
demeter declined them both because she mourned the loss of persephone
"baubo then, thinking she had displeased the goddess, lifted her skirt and showed her genitalia to the goddess, simultaneously revealing iacchus, demeter's son"
demeter was most pleased with the sight and delighted she accepted the food and wine
"this tale survives in the account of clement of alexandria, a christian who tried to discredit pagan practices and mythology"
"however, several baubo figurines  have been discovered, supporting the story"
"demeter's search for her daughter persephone took her to the palace of celeus, the king of eleusis in attica"
"she assumed the form of an old woman and asked him for shelter. he took her in, to nurse demophon and triptolemus, his sons by metanira"
"to reward his kindness, she planned to make demophon immortal; she secretly anointed the boy with ambrosia and laid him in the hearth's flames to gradually burn away his mortal self"
"but metanira walked in, saw her son in the fire and screamed in fright. demeter abandoned the attempt"
"instead, she taught triptolemus the secrets of agriculture, and he, in turn, taught them to any who wished to learn them"
"thus, humanity learned how to plant, grow and harvest grain"
"the myth has several versions; some are linked to figures such as eleusis, rarus and trochilus"
the demophon element may be based on an earlier folk tale
"homer's odyssey  contains perhaps the earliest direct references to the myth of demeter and her consort iasion, a samothracian hero whose name may refer to bindweed, a small white flower that frequently grows in wheat fields"
"in the odyssey, calypso describes how demeter, ""without disguise"", made love to iasion"
"""so it was when demeter of the braided tresses followed her heart and lay in love with iasion in the triple-furrowed field; zeus was aware of it soon enough and hurled the bright thunderbolt and killed him"
""" however, ovid states that iasion lived up to old age as the husband of demeter"
"in ancient greek culture, part of the opening of each agricultural year involved the cutting of three furrows in the field to ensure its fertility"
hesiod expanded on the basics of this myth
"according to him, the liaison between demeter and iasion took place at the wedding of cadmus and harmonia in crete"
"demeter, in this version, had lured iasion away from the other revellers. hesiod says that demeter subsequently gave birth to plutus"
"in arcadia, located in what is now southern greece, the major goddess despoina was considered the daughter of demeter and poseidon hippios"
"in the associated myths, poseidon represents the river spirit of the underworld, and he appears as a horse, as often happens in northern european folklore"
"the myth describes how he pursued his older sister, demeter, who hid from him among the horses of the king onkios, but even in the form of a mare, she could not conceal her divinity"
poseidon caught and raped his older sister in the form of a stallion
"demeter was furious at poseidon's assault; in this furious form, she became known as demeter erinys"
"her anger at poseidon drove her to dress all in black and retreat into a cave to purify herself, an act which was the cause of a universal famine"
"demeter's absence caused the death of crops, livestock, and eventually of the people who depended on them"
"demeter washed away her anger in the river ladon, becoming demeter lousia, the ""bathed demeter"""
"""in her alliance with poseidon,"" ker√©nyi noted, ""she was earth, who bears plants and beasts, and could therefore assume the shape of an ear of grain or a mare"
""" moreover, she bore a daughter despoina , whose name should not be uttered outside the arcadian mysteries, and a horse named arion, with a black mane and tail"
"at phigaleia, a xoanon  of demeter was erected in a cave which, tradition held, was the cave into which black demeter retreated"
"the statue depicted a medusa-like figure with a horse's head and snake-like hair, holding a dove and a dolphin, which probably represented her power over air and water: the second mountain, mount elaius, is some thirty stades away from phigalia, and has a cave sacred to demeter surnamed black"
".. the phigalians say, they concluded that this cavern was sacred to demeter and set up in it a wooden image"
"the image, they say, was made after this fashion. it was seated on a rock, like to a woman in all respects save the head"
"she had the head and hair of a horse, and there grew out of her head images of serpents and other beasts"
"her tunic reached right to her feet; on one of her hands was a dolphin, on the other a dove"
now why they had the image made after this fashion is plain to any intelligent man who is learned in traditions
they say that they named her black because the goddess had black apparel. they cannot relate either who made this wooden image or how it caught fire
"but the old image was destroyed, and the phigalians gave the goddess no fresh image, while they neglected for the most part her festivals and sacrifices, until the barrenness fell on the land"
"another myth involving demeter's rage resulting in famine is that of erysichthon, king of thessaly"
"the myth tells of erysichthon ordering all of the trees in one of demeter's sacred groves to be cut down, as he wanted to build an extension of his palace and hold feasts there"
"one tree, a huge oak, was covered with votive wreaths, symbols of the prayers demeter had granted, so erysichthon's men refused to cut it down"
"the king used an axe to cut it down, killing a dryad nymph in the process. the nymph's dying words were a curse on erysichthon"
"demeter punished the king by calling upon limos, the spirit of unrelenting and insatiable hunger, to enter his stomach"
"the more the king ate, the hungrier he became. erysichthon sold all his possessions to buy food but was still hungry"
"finally, he sold his daughter, mestra, into slavery"
"mestra was freed from slavery by her former lover, poseidon, who gave her the gift of shape-shifting into any creature to escape her bonds"
"erysichthon used her shape-shifting ability to sell her numerous times to make more money to feed himself, but no amount of food was enough"
"eventually, erysichthon ate himself"
"in a variation, erysichthon tore down a temple of demeter, wishing to build a roof for his house; she punished him the same way, and near the end of his life, she sent a snake to plague him"
"afterwards, demeter put him among the stars , as she did the snake, to continue to inflict its punishment on erysichthon"
"in the pergamon altar, which depicts the battle of the gods against the giants , survive remains of what seems to have been demeter fighting a giant labelled ""erysichthon"
""" demeter is also depicted fighting against the giants next to hermes in the suessula gigantomachy vase, now housed in the louvre museum"
"usually, ancient depictions of the gigantomachy tend to exclude demeter due to her non-martial nature"
"while travelling far and wide looking for her daughter, demeter arrived exhausted in attica"
"a woman named misme took her in and offered her a cup of water with pennyroyal and barley groats, for it was a hot day"
"demeter, in her thirst, swallowed the drink clumsily"
"witnessing that, misme's son ascalabus laughed, mocked her, and asked her if she would like a deep jar of that drink"
"demeter then poured her drink over him and turned him into a gecko, hated by both men and gods"
it was said that demeter showed her favour to those who killed geckos
"before hades abducted her daughter, he had kept the nymph minthe as his mistress. but after he married persephone, he set minthe aside"
minthe would often brag about being lovelier than persephone and say hades would soon come back to her and kick persephone out of his halls
"demeter, hearing that, grew angry and trampled minthe; from the earth then sprang a lovely-smelling herb named after the nymph"
"in other versions, persephone herself is the one who kills and turns minthe into a plant for sleeping with hades"
"in an argive myth, when demeter arrived in argolis, a man named colontas refused to receive her in his house, whereas his daughter chthonia disapproved of his actions"
"colontas was punished by being burnt along with his house, while demeter took chthonia to hermione, where she built a sanctuary for the goddess"
"demeter pinned ascalaphus under a rock for reporting, as sole witness, to hades that persephone had consumed some pomegranate seeds"
"later, after heracles rolled the stone off ascalaphus, demeter turned him into a short-eared owl instead"
demeter also turned the sirens into half-bird monsters for not helping her daughter persephone when she was abducted by hades
"once, the colchian princess medea ended a famine that plagued corinth by making sacrifices to demeter and the nymphs"
demeter gave triptolemus her serpent-drawn chariot and seed and bade him scatter it across the earth
"triptolemus rode through europe and asia until he came to the land of lyncus, a scythian king"
"lyncus pretended to offer what's accustomed of hospitality to him, but once triptolemus fell asleep, he attacked him with a dagger, wanting to take credit for his work"
demeter then saved triptolemus by turning lyncus into a lynx and ordered triptolemus to return home airborne
"hyginus records a very similar myth, in which demeter saves triptolemus from an evil king named carnabon who additionally seized triptolemus' chariot and killed one of the dragons, so he might not escape; demeter restored the chariot to triptolemus, substituted the dead dragon with another one, and punished carnabon by putting him among the stars holding a dragon as if to kill it"
"during her wanderings, demeter came upon the town of pheneus; to the pheneates that received her warmly and offered her shelter, she gave all sorts of pulse, except for beans, deeming it impure"
"two of the pheneates, trisaules and damithales, had a temple of demeter built for her"
"demeter also gifted a fig tree to phytalus, an eleusinian man, for welcoming her in his home"
"in the tale of eros and psyche, demeter, along with her sister hera, visited aphrodite, raging with fury about the girl who had married her son"
"aphrodite asks the two to search for her; the two try to talk sense into her, arguing that her son is not a little boy, although he might appear as one, and there's no harm in him falling in love with psyche"
aphrodite took offence at their words
"sometime later, psyche in her wanderings came across an abandoned shrine of demeter, and sorted out the neglected sickles and harvest implements she found there"
"as she was doing so, demeter appeared to her and called from afar; she warned the girl of aphrodite's great wrath and her plan to take revenge on her"
"then psyche begged the goddess to help her, but demeter answered that she could not interfere and incur aphrodite's anger at her, and for that reason, psyche had to leave the shrine or else be kept as a captive of hers"
"when her son philomelus invented the plough and used it to cultivate the fields, demeter was so impressed by his good work that she immortalized him in the sky by turning him into a constellation, the bo√∂tes"
"hierax, a man of justice and distinction, set up sanctuaries for demeter and received plenteous harvests from her in return"
"when the tribe neglected poseidon favour of demeter, the sea god destroyed all of her crops, so hierax sent them instead his own food and was transformed into a hawk by poseidon"
"besides giving gifts to those who were welcoming to her, demeter was also a goddess who nursed the young; all of plemaeus's children born by his first wife died in a cradle; demeter took pity on him and reared herself his son orthopolis"
"plemaeus built a temple to her to thank her. demeter also raised trophonius, the prophetic son of either apollo or erginus"
"demeter seems to have accompanied dionysus when he descended into the underworld to retrieve his mother semele in order to visit her now married daughter, and perhaps lead her back to the land of the living for the remainder of the year"
"in many vases from athens dionysus is seen in the company of mother and daughter.once tantalus, a son of zeus, invited the gods over for dinner"
elefsina  or eleusis  is a suburban city and municipality in the west attica regional unit of greece
"it is located in the thriasio plain, at the northernmost end of the saronic gulf"
"north of elefsina are mandra and magoula, while aspropyrgos is to the northeast"
it is the site of the eleusinian mysteries and the birthplace of aeschylus
"today, elefsina is a major industrial centre, with the largest oil refinery in greece as well as the home of the aeschylia festival, the longest-lived arts event in the attica region"
"on 11 november 2016, elefsina was named the european capital of culture for 2021, which became effective in 2023 due to the covid-19 pandemic postponement"
"the word eleusis first appears at the orphic hymn ¬´Œ¥ŒÆŒºŒ∑œÑœÅŒøœÇ ŒµŒªŒµœÖœÉŒπŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ, Œ∏œÖŒºŒØŒ±ŒºŒ± œÉœÑœçœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±¬ª"
also hesychius of alexandria reports that the older name for eleusis was saesara
"saesara was the mythic daughter of celeus  and granddaughter of eleusinus, the first settler of eleusis"
"the municipality of elefsina was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following two former municipalities, that became municipal units: elefsina magoulathe municipality has an area of 36"
"589 km2 , and the municipal unit has an area of 18.455 km2 . eleusis was a deme of ancient attica, belonging to the phyle hippotho√∂ntis"
"it owed its celebrity to its being the chief seat of the worship of demeter and persephone, and to the mysteries celebrated in honour of these goddesses, which were called the eleusinia, and continued to be regarded as the most sacred of all the grecian mysteries down to the fall of paganism"
"eleusis stood upon a height at a short distance from the sea, and opposite the island of salamis. its situation possessed three natural advantages"
"it was on the road from athens to the isthmus of corinth; it was in a very fertile plain; and it was at the head of an extensive bay, formed on three sides by the coast of attica, and shut in on the south by the island of salamis"
the town itself dates from the most ancient times. the caves on the coast of eleusis are home to a mythological place for the greek world
there is a cave said to be the very spot where persephone was abducted by hades himself and the cave was considered a gateway to tartarus
at the spot of this abduction was a sanctuary  dedicated to hades and persephone
the rharian plain is also mentioned in the homeric hymn to artemis; it appears to have been in the neighbourhood of the city; but its site cannot be determined
"mythology and proto-history it appears to have derived its name from the supposed advent  of demeter, though some traced its name from an eponymous hero eleusis"
it was one of the 12 independent states into which attica was said to have been originally divided
"""when athens had only just become athens, it went to war with another city built thirteen miles away: eleusis,"" roberto calasso wrote of the ancient provenance of the relationship between temple-city and the attic seat of power"
"""it was a war usually described as mythical, since it has no date"
"and it was a theological war, since athens belonged to athena and eleusis to poseidon"
"eumolpus and erechtheus, the founding kings of the two cities, both died in it"
"""it is related that in the reign of eumolpus, king of eleusis, and erechtheus, king of athens, there was a war between the two states, in which the eleusinians were defeated, whereupon they agreed to acknowledge the supremacy of athens in everything except the celebration of the mysteries, of which they were to continue to have the management"
"eleusis afterwards became an attic deme, but in consequence of its sacred character it was allowed to retain the title of polis  and to coin its own money, a privilege possessed by no other town in attica, except athens"
the history of eleusis is part of the history of athens
"once a year the great eleusinian procession travelled from athens to eleusis, along the sacred way"
"eleusinian mysteries eleusis was the site of the eleusinian mysteries, or the mysteries of demeter and kore, which became popular in the greek-speaking world as early as 600 bc, and attracted initiates during roman empire before declining mid-late 4th century ad"
these mysteries revolved around a belief that there was a hope for life after death for those who were initiated
such a belief was cultivated from the introduction ceremony in which the hopeful initiates were shown a number of things including the seed of life in a stalk of grain
the central myth of the mysteries was demeter's quest for her lost daughter  who had been abducted by hades
"it was here that demeter, disguised as an old lady who was abducted by pirates in crete, came to an old well where the four daughters of the local king keleos and his queen metaneira  found her and took her to their palace to nurse the son of keleos and metaneira, demophoon"
"demeter raised demophoon, anointing him with nectar and ambrosia and placing him at night in the fire in order to endow him with immortality, until metaneira found out and insulted her"
"demeter arose insulted, and casting off her disguise, and, in all her glory, instructed meteneira to build a temple to her"
"keleos, informed the next morning by metaneira, ordered the citizens to build a rich shrine to demeter, where she sat in her temple until the lot of the world prayed to zeus to make the world provide food again"
"the great eleusian relief which was famous in antiquity and was copied in the roman period, is the largest and most important votive relief found and dates to 440-430 bc"
it represents the eleusinian deities in a scene of mysterious rituel
"on the left demeter, clad in a peplos and holding a sceptre in her left hand, offers ears of wheat to triptolemos, son of eleusinian king keleos, to bestow on mankind"
"on the right persephone, clad in chiton and mantle and holding a torch, blesses triptolemos with her right hand"
"the original marble relief was found at the sanctuary of demeter, the site of the eleusinian mysteries. a number of roman copies also survive"
"greek and roman history during the greco-persian wars, the ancient temple of demeter was burnt down by the persians in 484 bc; and it was not till the administration of pericles that an attempt was made to rebuild it"
"when the power of the thirty tyrants was overthrown after the peloponnesian war, they retired to eleusis, which they had secured beforehand, but where they maintained themselves for only a short time"
"the town of eleusis and its immediate neighbourhood were exposed to inundations from the river cephissus, which, though almost dry during the greater part of the year, is sometimes swollen to such an extent as to spread itself over a large part of the plain"
"demosthenes  alludes to inundations at eleusis;pausanias  has left us only a very brief description of eleusis; the eleusinians have a temple of triptolemus, another of artemis propylaea, and a third of poseidon the father, and a well called callichorum, where the eleusinian women first instituted a dance and sang in honour of the goddess"
"they say that the rharian plain was the first place in which corn was sown and first produced a harvest, and that hence barley from this plain is employed for making sacrificial cakes"
there the so-called threshing-floor and altar of triptolemus are shown. the things within the wall of the hierum  a dream forbade me to describe
"under the romans eleusis enjoyed great prosperity, as initiation into its mysteries became fashionable among the roman nobles"
hadrian was initiated into the mysteries in about 125 and raised embankments in the plain of the river in consequence of an flood which occurred while he was spending the winter at athens
"to the same emperor most likely eleusis was indebted for a supply of good water by means of the aqueduct, completed in about 160 ad"
"apart from satisfying the need for drinking water, it also enabled the construction of public fountains and baths"
it was fed by springs in mount parnitha and used mainly underground tunnels
it crossed the thriasian plain and turned abruptly towards the south at the outskirts of eleusis
"the best visible remains are on the east side of dimitros street. it was destroyed by alaric i in 396 ad, and from that time disappears from history"
"the telesterion, or temple of demeter, was the largest in all greece, and is described by strabo as capable of containing as many persons as a theatre"
"the building was initially designed by ictinus, the architect of the parthenon at athens; but it was many years before it was completed, and the names of several architects are preserved who were employed in building it"
"during its long history, the temple underwent subsequent building phases. much of that visible today is of the classical era"
"its portico of 12 columns was added in the time of demetrius phalereus, about 318 bc, by the architect philo"
"when finished, it was considered one of the four finest examples of grecian architecture in marble"
modifications were also carried out in roman times
the roman bridge that carried the ancient sacred way over the kephissus river is visible about 1 km from the sanctuary of demeter
the bridge is in very good condition and is an outstanding example of ancient bridge building
it consists of a central 30 m-long main bridge with 4 arches and 10 m-long sloping access on either side
"the sacred way was the main road from athens and led to demeter's sanctuary, and was also the road used by the procession every year of the celebration of the great mysteries escorting the sacred objects back to eleusis"
its course is visible in some places and has been accurately traced by rescue excavations and ran parallel to its namesake in the modern city only a few metres to the south
roadside cemeteries from different periods throughout antiquity are found next to it and prehistoric graves witness its existence by 1600 bc
"during the hellenistic and mainly roman eras the road was used for the exhibition of wealth and social power, with costly burial monuments being erected all along it"
the road was in use until at least the 6th century ad
"it is indicative that writers of the byzantine era refer to it as a ""small village"", and shortly before the ottoman domination the area was deserted by wars, raids and captives"
during this period was settled by arvanites
european travelers during the ottoman domination described eleusis as having few inhabitants and many ancient ruins
"in 1829, after the greek war of independence, elefsina was a small settlement of about 250 inhabitants"
by the late 19th century elefsina changed drastically as new buildings were erected by the new merchant settlers
"also during that period eleusis became one of the main industrial centers of the modern greek state with concrete factory titan, charilaou soap factory as well as the distilleries of botrys and kronos being established in the area"
"arvanitika is still spoken in the village, with the locals qualifying their dialect more ""noble"" and ""refined"" than those of rural arvanites"
"many greek families of asia minor settled in elefsina after the 1922 asia minor catastrophe and created the settlement of upper elefsina, doubling its total population and enriching the region culturally and economically"
"during the axis occupation of greece , strong resistance developed within the city, the factories and the military airport, which once stationed squadron 80, the squadron that roald dahl was assigned to in the raf"
"after world war ii, workers from all parts of greece moved to elefsina to work in the industries in the region"
"industrial activity, however, developed anarchically on the antiquities and next to the residential area"
environmental pollution has taken on large dimensions
"during the 20th century, at the time of sustainable development, archaeological discoveries and industrial formation shaped the image of contemporary eleusis"
"in 1962, a large house of priests from the roman era was discovered. pollution thanks to citizens' struggles gradually has fallen"
"today, the city has become a suburb of athens, to which it is linked by the motorway 6 and greek national road 8"
"eleusis is nowadays a major industrial area, and the place where the majority of crude oil in greece is imported and refined"
"the largest refinery is located on the west side of town, right beside where the annual aeschylia festival is held in honor of the great tragic poet aeschylus"
there is a military airport a few kilometers east of elefsina
"elefsina airfield played a crucial role in the final british evacuation during the 1941 battle of greece, as recounted by roald dahl in his autobiography going solo"
"elefsina is home to the football club panelefsiniakos f.c., and the basketball club panelefsiniakos b.c"
"established in 1975, the aeschylia festival in eleusis in western attica is the currently the longest standing cultural event organized by an attica municipality"
"it is held annually at palaio elaiourgeio, a former soap factory by the seafront that functions as an open theatre"
"religious practices in ancient greece encompassed a collection of beliefs, rituals, and mythology, in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices"
"the application of the modern concept of ""religion"" to ancient cultures has been questioned as anachronistic"
the ancient greeks did not have a word for 'religion' in the modern sense
"likewise, no greek writer known to us classifies either the gods or the cult practices into separate 'religions'"
"instead, for example, herodotus speaks of the hellenes as having ""common shrines of the gods and sacrifices, and the same kinds of customs"
"""most ancient greeks recognized the twelve major olympian gods and goddesses‚Äîzeus, hera, poseidon, demeter, athena, ares, aphrodite, apollo, artemis, hephaestus, hermes, and either hestia or dionysus‚Äîalthough philosophies such as stoicism and some forms of platonism used language that seems to assume a single transcendent deity"
"the worship of these deities, and several others, was found across the greek world, though they often have different epithets that distinguished aspects of the deity, and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-hellenic scheme"
"the religious practices of the greeks extended beyond mainland greece, to the islands and coasts of ionia in asia minor, to magna graecia , and to scattered greek colonies in the western mediterranean, such as massalia"
early italian religions such as the etruscan religion were influenced by greek religion and subsequently influenced much of the ancient roman religion
"""there was no centralization of authority over greek religious practices and beliefs; change was regulated only at the civic level"
"thus, the phenomenon we are studying is not in fact an organized ""religion"
""" instead we might think of the beliefs and practices of greeks in relation to the gods as a group of closely related ""religious dialects"" that resembled each other far more than they did those of non-greeks"
""" ancient greek theology was polytheistic, based on the assumption that there were many gods and goddesses, as well as a range of lesser supernatural beings of various types"
"there was a hierarchy of deities, with zeus, the king of the gods, having a level of control over all the others, although he was not almighty"
some deities had dominion over certain aspects of nature
"for instance, zeus was the sky-god, sending thunder and lightning, poseidon ruled over the sea and earthquakes, hades projected his remarkable power throughout the realms of death and the underworld, and helios controlled the sun"
other deities ruled over abstract concepts; for instance aphrodite controlled love
"all significant deities were visualized as ""human"" in form, although often able to transform themselves into animals or natural phenomena"
"while being immortal, the gods were certainly not all-good or even all-powerful"
"they had to obey fate, known to greek mythology as the moirai, which overrode any of their divine powers or wills"
"for instance, in mythology, it was odysseus' fate to return home to ithaca after the trojan war, and the gods could only lengthen his journey and make it harder for him, not stop him"
"the gods acted like humans and had human vices. they interacted with humans, sometimes even spawning children with them"
"at times certain gods would be opposed to others, and they would try to outdo each other"
"in the iliad, aphrodite, ares and apollo support the trojan side in the trojan war, while hera, athena and poseidon support the greeks"
some gods were specifically associated with a certain city
"athena was associated with athens, apollo with delphi and delos, zeus with olympia and aphrodite with corinth"
but other gods were also worshipped in these cities
"other deities were associated with nations outside of greece; poseidon was associated with ethiopia and troy, and ares with thrace"
"identity of names was not a guarantee of a similar cultus; the greeks themselves were well aware that the artemis worshipped at sparta, the virgin huntress, was a very different deity from the artemis who was a many-breasted fertility goddess at ephesus"
"though worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another, and though most larger cities had temples to several major gods, the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end"
"ancient sources for greek religion tell a good deal about cult but very little about creed, in no small measure because the greeks in general considered what one believed to be much less importance than what one did"
the greeks believed in an underworld inhabited by the spirits of the dead
"one of the most widespread areas of this underworld was ruled by hades, a brother of zeus, and was also known as hades"
"other well-known realms are tartarus, a place of torment for the damned, and elysium, a place of pleasures for the virtuous"
"in the early mycenaean religion all the dead went to hades, but the rise of mystery cults in the archaic age led to the development of places such as tartarus and elysium"
"a few greeks, like achilles, alcmene, amphiaraus ganymede, ino, melicertes, menelaus, peleus, and a great number of those who fought in the trojan and theban wars, were considered to have been physically immortalized and brought to live forever in either elysium, the islands of the blessed, heaven, the ocean, or beneath the ground"
"such beliefs are found in the most ancient greek sources, such as homer and hesiod. this belief remained strong even into the christian era"
"for most people at the moment of death there was, however, no hope of anything but continued existence as a disembodied soul"
"some greeks, such as the philosophers pythagoras and plato, also embraced the idea of reincarnation, though this was only accepted by a few"
"epicurus taught that the soul was simply atoms which were dissolved at death, so one ceased to exist on dying"
greek religion had an extensive mythology. it consisted largely of stories of the gods and how they interacted with humans
"myths often revolved around heroes and their actions, such as heracles and his twelve labors, odysseus and his voyage home, jason and the quest for the golden fleece and theseus and the minotaur"
"many species existed in greek mythology. chief among these were the gods and humans, though the titans  also frequently appeared in greek myths"
"lesser species included the half-man-half-horse centaurs, the nature-based nymphs  and the half-man, half-goat satyrs"
"some creatures in greek mythology were monstrous, such as the one-eyed giant cyclopes, the sea beast scylla, whirlpool charybdis, gorgons, and the half-man, half-bull minotaur"
"there was no set greek cosmogony, or creation myth. different religious groups believed that the world had been created in different ways"
one greek creation myth was told in hesiod's theogony
"it stated that at first there was only a primordial deity called chaos, after which came various other primordial gods, such as gaia, tartarus and eros, who then gave birth to more gods, the titans, who then gave birth to the first olympians"
the mythology largely survived and was expanded to form the later roman mythology
"the greeks and romans were literate societies, and much mythology, although initially shared orally, was written down in the forms of epic poetry  and plays"
"the mythology became popular in christian post-renaissance europe, where it was often used as a basis for the works of artists like botticelli, michelangelo and rubens"
one of the most important moral concepts to the greeks was aversion to hubris
"hubris constituted many things, from rape to desecration of a corpse, and was a crime in athens"
"although pride and vanity were not considered sins themselves, the greeks emphasized moderation"
"pride only became hubris when it went to extremes, like any other vice. the same was thought of eating and drinking"
the same was thought of eating and drinking. anything done to excess was not considered proper
"anything done to excess was not considered proper. ancient greeks placed, for example, importance on athletics and intellect equally"
in fact many of their competitions included both. pride was not evil until it became all-consuming or hurtful to others
"the greeks had no religious texts they regarded as ""revealed"" scriptures of sacred origin, but very old texts including homer's iliad and odyssey, and the homeric hymns , hesiod's theogony and works and days, and pindar's odes were regarded as authoritative and perhaps inspired; they usually begin with an invocation to the muses for inspiration"
plato even wanted to exclude the myths from his ideal state described in the republic because of their low moral tone
"while some traditions, such as mystery cults, upheld certain texts as canonic within their praxis, such texts were respected but not necessarily accepted as canonic outside their circle"
"in this field, of particular importance are certain texts referring to orphic cults: multiple copies, ranging from 450 bc‚Äì250 ad, have been found in various parts of the greek world"
even the words of the oracles never became a sacred text
"other texts were specially composed for religious events, and some have survived within the lyric tradition; although they had a cult function, they were bound to performance and never developed into a common, standard prayer form comparable to the christian pater noster"
"an exception to this rule were the already named orphic and mystery rituals, which, in this, set themselves aside from the rest of the greek religious system"
"finally, some texts called ieri logi   by the ancient sources, originated from outside the greek world, or were supposedly adopted in remote times, representing yet more different traditions within the greek belief system"
"the lack of a unified priestly class meant that a unified, canonic form of the religious texts or practices never existed; just as there was no unified, common sacred text for the greek belief system, there was no standardization of practices"
"instead, religious practices were organized on local levels, with priests normally being magistrates for the city or village, or gaining authority from one of the many sanctuaries"
"some priestly functions, like the care for a particular local festival, could be given by tradition to a certain family"
"to a large extent, in the absence of ""scriptural"" sacred texts, religious practices derived their authority from tradition, and ""every omission or deviation arouses deep anxiety and calls forth sanctions"""
greek ceremonies and rituals were mainly performed at altars
"these were typically devoted to one or a few gods, and supported a statue of the particular deity"
"votive deposits were left at the altar, such as food, drinks, as well as precious objects"
"sometimes animal sacrifices were performed here, with most of the flesh taken for eating and the offal burnt as an offering to the gods"
"libations, often of wine, would be offered to the gods as well, not only at shrines, but also in everyday life, such as during a symposium"
"one ceremony was pharmakos, a ritual involving expelling a symbolic scapegoat such as a slave or an animal, from a city or village in a time of hardship"
"it was hoped that by casting out the ritual scapegoat, the hardship would go with it"
worship in greece typically consisted of sacrificing domestic animals at the altar with hymn and prayer
"the altar was outside any temple building, and might not be associated with a temple at all"
"the animal, which should be perfect of its kind, was decorated with garlands and the like, and led in procession to the altar; a girl with a basket on her head containing the concealed knife led the way"
"after various rituals, the animal was slaughtered over the altar. as it fell, all the women present "" out in high, shrill tones"""
its blood was collected and poured over the altar
"it was butchered on the spot and various internal organs, bones and other inedible parts burnt as the deity's portion of the offering, while the meat was removed to be prepared for the participants to eat; the leading figures tasted it on the spot"
the temple usually kept the skin to sell to tanners
"that humans got more use from the sacrifice than the deity did not escape the greeks, and was often the subject of humor in greek comedy"
"the animals used were, in order of preference, bulls or oxen, cows, sheep , goats, pigs , and poultry"
"horses and asses are seen on some vases in the geometric style , but are very rarely mentioned in literature; they were relatively late introductions to greece, and it has been suggested that greek preferences in this matter were established earlier"
"the greeks liked to believe that the animal was glad to be sacrificed, and interpreted various behaviors as showing this"
"divination by examining parts of the sacrificed animal was much less important than in roman or etruscan religion, or near eastern religions, but was practiced, especially of the liver, and as part of the cult of apollo"
"generally, the greeks put more faith in observing the behavior of birds"
"for a smaller and simpler offering, a grain of incense could be thrown on the sacred fire, and outside the cities farmers made simple sacrificial gifts of plant produce as the ""first fruits"" were harvested"
"the libation, a ritual pouring of fluid, was part of everyday life, and libations with a prayer were often made at home whenever wine was drunk, with just a part of the cup's contents, the rest being drunk"
"more formal ones might be made onto altars at temples, and other fluids such as olive oil and honey might be used"
"although the grand form of sacrifice called the hecatomb  might in practice only involve a dozen or so, at large festivals the number of cattle sacrificed could run into the hundreds, and the numbers feasting on them well into the thousands"
"the evidence of the existence of such practices is clear in some ancient greek literature, especially homer's epics"
"throughout the poems, the use of the ritual is apparent at banquets where meat is served, in times of danger or before some important endeavor to gain the gods' favor"
"for example, in the odyssey eumaeus sacrifices a pig with prayer for his unrecognizable master odysseus"
"but in the iliad, which partly reflects very early greek civilization, not every banquet of the princes begins with a sacrifice"
these sacrificial practices share much with recorded forms of sacrificial rituals known from later
"furthermore, throughout the poem, special banquets are held whenever gods indicated their presence by some sign or success in war"
"before setting out for troy, this type of animal sacrifice is offered. odysseus offers zeus a sacrificial ram in vain"
"the occasions of sacrifice in homer's epic poems may shed some light onto the view of gods as members of society, rather than external entities, indicating social ties"
sacrificial rituals played a major role in forming the relationship between humans and the divine
"it has been suggested that the chthonic deities, distinguished from olympic deities by typically being offered the holocaust mode of sacrifice, where the offering is wholly burnt, may be remnants of the native pre-hellenic religion, and that many of the olympian deities may come from the proto-greeks who overran the southern part of the balkan peninsula in the late third millennium bc"
various religious festivals were held in ancient greece. many were specific only to a particular deity or city-state
"for example, the festival of lykaia was celebrated in arcadia in greece, which was dedicated to the pastoral god pan"
"like the other panhellenic games, the ancient olympic games were a religious festival, held at the sanctuary of zeus at olympia"
"other festivals centered on greek theatre, of which the dionysia in athens was the most important"
"more typical festivals featured a procession, large sacrifices and a feast to eat the offerings, and many included entertainments and customs such as visiting friends, wearing fancy dress and unusual behavior in the streets, sometimes risky for bystanders in various ways"
"altogether the year in athens included some 140 days that were religious festivals of some sort, though they varied greatly in importance"
"one rite of passage was the amphidromia, celebrated on the fifth or seventh day after the birth of a child"
"childbirth was extremely significant to athenians, especially if the baby was a boy"
"the main greek temple building sat within a larger precinct or temenos, usually surrounded by a peribolos fence or wall; the whole is usually called a ""sanctuary"""
"the acropolis of athens is the most famous example, though this was apparently walled as a citadel before a temple was ever built there"
"the tenemos might include many subsidiary buildings, sacred groves or springs, animals dedicated to the deity, and sometimes people who had taken sanctuary from the law, which some temples offered, for example to runaway slaves"
"the earliest greek sanctuaries probably lacked temple buildings, though our knowledge of these is limited, and the subject is controversial"
"a typical early sanctuary seems to have consisted of a tenemos, often around a sacred grove, cave, rock  or spring, and perhaps defined only by marker stones at intervals, with an altar for offerings"
"many rural sanctuaries probably stayed in this style, but the more popular were gradually able to afford a building to house a cult image, especially in cities"
"this process was certainly under way by the 9th century, and probably started earlier"
"the temple interiors did not serve as meeting places, since the sacrifices and rituals dedicated to the respective deity took place outside them, at altars within the wider precinct of the sanctuary, which might be large"
"as the centuries passed both the inside of popular temples and the area surrounding them accumulated statues and small shrines or other buildings as gifts, and military trophies, paintings and items in precious metals, effectively turning them into a type of museum"
"some sanctuaries offered oracles, people who were believed to receive divine inspiration in answering questions put by pilgrims"
"the most famous of these by far was the female priestess called the pythia at the temple of apollo at delphi, and that of zeus at dodona, but there were many others"
"some dealt only with medical, agricultural or other specialized matters, and not all represented gods, like that of the hero trophonius at livadeia"
"the temple was the house of the deity it was dedicated to, who in some sense resided in the cult image in the cella or main room inside, normally facing the only door"
"the cult image normally took the form of a statue of the deity, typically roughly life-size, but in some cases many times life-size"
"in early days these were in wood, marble or terracotta, or in the specially prestigious form of a chryselephantine statue using ivory plaques for the visible parts of the body and gold for the clothes, around a wooden framework"
"the most famous greek cult images were of this type, including the statue of zeus at olympia, and phidias's athena parthenos in the parthenon in athens, both colossal statues, now completely lost"
"fragments of two chryselephantine statues from delphi have been excavated. bronze cult images were less frequent, at least until hellenistic times"
"early images seem often to have been dressed in real clothes, and at all periods images might wear real jewelry donated by devotees"
"the acrolith was another composite form, this time a cost-saving one with a wooden body"
"a xoanon was a primitive and symbolic wooden image, perhaps comparable to the hindu lingam; many of these were retained and revered for their antiquity, even when a new statue was the main cult image"
xoana had the advantage that they were easy to carry in processions at festivals
"the trojan palladium, famous from the myths of the epic cycle and supposedly ending up in rome, was one of these"
"the sacred boulder or baetyl is another very primitive type, found around the mediterranean and ancient near east"
"many of the greek statues well known from roman marble copies were originally temple cult images, which in some cases, such as the apollo barberini, can be credibly identified"
"a very few actual originals survive, for example, the bronze piraeus athena  high, including a helmet)"
"the image stood on a base, from the 5th century often carved with reliefs"
"it used to be thought that access to the cella of a greek temple was limited to the priests, and it was entered only rarely by other visitors, except perhaps during important festivals or other special occasions"
"in recent decades this picture has changed, and scholars now stress the variety of local access rules"
"pausanias was a gentlemanly traveller of the 2nd-century ad who declares that the special intention of his travels around greece was to see cult images, and usually managed to do so"
"it was typically necessary to make a sacrifice or gift, and some temples restricted access either to certain days of the year, or by class, race, gender , or even more tightly"
"garlic-eaters were forbidden in one temple, in another women unless they were virgins; restrictions typically arose from local ideas of ritual purity or a perceived whim of the deity"
in some places visitors were asked to show they spoke greek; elsewhere dorians were not allowed entry
some temples could only be viewed from the threshold. some temples are said never to be opened at all
"some temples are said never to be opened at all. but generally greeks, including slaves, had a reasonable expectation of being allowed into the cella"
"once inside the cella it was possible to pray to or before the cult image, and sometimes to touch it; cicero saw a bronze image of heracles with its foot largely worn away by the touch of devotees"
famous cult images such as the statue of zeus at olympia functioned as significant visitor attractions
the role of women in sacrifices is discussed above
"in addition, the only public roles that greek women could perform were priestesses: either hiereiai, meaning ""sacred women"", or amphipolis, a term for lesser attendants"
"as priestesses, they gained social recognition and access to more luxuries than other greek women who worked or stayed in the home"
"they were mostly from local elite families; some roles required virgins, who typically only served for a year or so before marriage, while other roles went to married women"
"women who voluntarily chose to become priestesses received an increase in social and legal status to the public, and after death, they received a public burial site"
"greek priestesses had to be healthy and of a sound mind, the reasoning being that the ones serving the gods had to be as high-quality as their offerings"
this was also true of male greek priests
"it is contested whether there were gendered divisions when it came to serving a particular god or goddess, who was devoted to what god, gods and/or goddesses could have both priests and priestesses to serve them"
gender specifics did come into play when it came to who would perform certain acts of sacrifice or worship
"per the significance of the male or female role to a particular god or goddess, a priest would lead the priestess or the reverse"
"in some greek cults priestesses served both gods and goddesses; pythia, or female oracle of apollo at delphi, and that at didyma were priestesses, but both were overseen by male priests"
the festival of dionosyus was practiced by both and the god was served by women and female priestesses known as the gerarai or the venerable ones
"there were segregated religious festivals in ancient greece; the thesmophoria, plerosia, kalamaia, adonia, and skira were festivals that were only for women"
"the thesmophoria festival and many others represented agricultural fertility, which was considered to be closely connected to women"
"it gave women a religious identity and purpose in greek religion, in which the role of women in worshipping goddesses demeter and her daughter persephone reinforced traditional lifestyles"
the festivals relating to agricultural fertility were valued by the polis because this is what they traditionally worked for; women-centered festivals that involved private matters were less important
in athens the festivals honoring demeter were included in the calendar and promoted by athens
"they constructed temples and shrines like the thesmophorion, where women could perform their rites and worship"
those who were not satisfied by the public cult of the gods could turn to various mystery religions that operated as cults into which members had to be initiated in order to learn their secrets
"here, they could find religious consolations that traditional religion could not provide: a chance at mystical awakening, a systematic religious doctrine, a map to the afterlife, a communal worship, and a band of spiritual fellowship"
"some of these mysteries, like the mysteries of eleusis and samothrace, were ancient and local"
"others were spread from place to place, like the mysteries of dionysus"
"during the hellenistic period and the roman empire, exotic mystery religions became widespread, not only in greece, but all across the empire"
"some of these were new creations, such as mithras, while others had been practiced for hundreds of years before, like the egyptian mysteries of osiris"
mainstream greek religion appears to have developed out of proto-indo-european religion and although very little is known about the earliest periods there are suggestive hints that some local elements go back even further than the bronze age or helladic period to the farmers of neolithic greece
there was also clearly cultural evolution from the late helladic mycenaean religion of the mycenaean civilization
both the literary settings of some important myths and many important sanctuaries relate to locations that were important helladic centers that had become otherwise unimportant by greek times
"the mycenaeans perhaps treated poseidon, to them a god of earthquakes as well as the sea, as their chief deity, and forms of his name along with several other olympians are recognizable in records in linear b, while apollo and aphrodite are absent"
only about half of the mycenaean pantheon seems to survive the greek dark ages
the archaeological evidence for continuity in religion is far clearer for crete and cyprus than the greek mainland
"greek religious concepts may also have absorbed the beliefs and practices of earlier, nearby cultures, such as minoan religion, and other influences came from the near east, especially via cyprus"
"herodotus, writing in the 5th century bc, traced many greek religious practices to egypt"
"the great goddess hypothesis, that a stone age religion dominated by a female great goddess was displaced by a male-dominated indo-european hierarchy, has been proposed for greece as for minoan crete and other regions, but has not been in favor with specialists for some decades, though the question remains too poorly evidenced for a clear conclusion; at the least the evidence from minoan art shows more goddesses than gods"
"the twelve olympians, with zeus as sky father, certainly have a strong indo-european flavor; by the time of the epic works of homer all are well-established, except for dionysus, but several of the homeric hymns, probably composed slightly later, are dedicated to him"
"archaic and classical greece saw the development of flourishing cities and of stone-built temples to the gods, which were rather consistent in design across the greek world"
"religion was closely tied to civic life, and priests were mostly drawn from the local elite"
"religious works led the development of greek sculpture, though apparently not the now-vanished greek painting"
"while much religious practice was, as well as personal, aimed at developing solidarity within the polis, a number of important sanctuaries developed a ""panhellenic"" status, drawing visitors from all over the greek world"
these served as an essential component in the growth and self-consciousness of greek nationalism
the mainstream religion of the greeks did not go unchallenged within greece
"as greek philosophy developed its ideas about ethics, the olympians were found wanting. several notable philosophers criticized belief in the gods"
"the earliest of these was xenophanes, who chastised the gods' human vices and their anthropomorphic depiction"
"plato wrote that there was one supreme god, whom he called the ""form of the good"", which he believed was the emanation of perfection in the universe"
"plato's disciple aristotle also disagreed that polytheistic deities existed, because he could not find enough empirical evidence for it"
"he believed in a prime mover, which had set creation going but was not connected to or interested in the universe"
"in the hellenistic period between the death of alexander the great in 323 bc and the roman conquest of greece , greek religion developed in various ways, including expanding over at least some of alexander's conquests"
"the new dynasties of diadochi, kings and tyrants often spent lavishly on temples, often following alexander in trying to insinuate themselves into religious cult; this was much easier for the ptolemaic dynasty of egypt, where the traditional ancient egyptian religion had long had deified monarchs"
the enormous raised pergamon altar  and the altar of hieron in sicily are examples of unprecedentedly large constructions of the period
"new cults of imported deities such as isis from egypt, atargatis from syria, and cybele from anatolia became increasingly important, as well as several philosophical movements such as platonism, stoicism, and epicureanism; both tended to detract from the traditional religion, although many greeks were able to hold beliefs from more than one of these groups"
"serapis was essentially a hellenistic creation, if not devised then spread in egypt for political reasons by ptolemy i soter as a hybrid of greek and local styles of deity"
"various philosophical movements, including the orphics and pythagoreans, began to question the ethics of animal sacrifice, and whether the gods really appreciated it; from the surviving texts empedocles and theophrastus  were notable critics"
"hellenistic astrology developed late in the period, as another distraction from the traditional practices"
"although traditional myths, festivals and beliefs all continued, these trends probably reduced the grip on the imagination of the traditional pantheon, especially among the educated, but also in the general population"
"when the roman republic conquered greece in 146 bc, it took much of greek religion  and incorporated it into its own"
"the greek gods were equated with the ancient roman deities; zeus with jupiter, hera with juno, poseidon with neptune, aphrodite with venus, ares with mars, artemis with diana, athena with minerva, hermes with mercury, hephaestus with vulcan, hestia with vesta, demeter with ceres, hades with pluto, tyche with fortuna, and pan with faunus"
"some of the gods, such as apollo and bacchus, had earlier been adopted by the romans"
"there were also many deities that existed in the roman religion before its interaction with greece that were not associated with a greek deity, including janus and quirinus"
"the romans generally did not spend much on new temples in greece other than those for their imperial cult, which were placed in all important cities"
"exceptions include antoninus pius , whose commissions include the baalbec temple of bacchus, arguably the most impressive survival from the imperial period"
it could be said the greek world was by this time well furnished with sanctuaries
"roman governors and emperors often pilfered famous statues from sanctuaries, sometimes leaving contemporary reproductions in their place"
"verres, governor of sicily from 73 to 70 bc, was an early example who, unusually, was prosecuted after his departure"
"after the huge roman conquests beyond greece, new cults from egypt and asia became popular in greece as well as the western empire"
"the initial decline of greco-roman polytheism was due in part to its syncretic nature, assimilating beliefs and practices from a variety of foreign religious traditions as the roman empire expanded"
"greco-roman philosophical schools incorporated elements of judaism and early christianity, and mystery religions like christianity and mithraism also became increasingly popular"
"constantine i became the first roman emperor to convert to christianity, and the edict of milan in 313 ad enacted official tolerance for christianity within the empire"
"still, in greece and elsewhere, there is evidence that pagan and christian communities remained essentially segregated from each other, with little mutual cultural influence"
"urban pagans continued to use the civic centers and temple complexes, while christians set up their own, new places of worship in suburban areas"
"contrary to some older scholarship, newly converted christians did not simply continue worshiping in converted temples; rather, new christian communities formed as older pagan communities declined and were eventually suppressed and disbanded"
"the roman emperor julian, a nephew of constantine, initiated an effort to end the ascension of christianity within the empire and reorganize a syncretic version of greco-roman polytheism that he termed ""hellenism"""
"later known as ""the apostate"", julian had been raised christian but embraced his ancestors' paganism in early adulthood"
"taking notice of how christianity ultimately flourished under suppression, julian pursued a policy of marginalization but not destruction towards the church; tolerating and at times lending state support to other prominent faiths  when he believed doing so would be likely to weaken christianity"
"julian's christian training influenced his decision to create a single organized version of the various old pagan traditions, with a centralized priesthood and a coherent body of doctrine, ritual, and liturgy based on neoplatonism"
"on the other hand, julian forbade christian educators from utilizing many of the great works of philosophy and literature associated with greco-roman paganism"
he believed christianity had benefited significantly from not only access to but influence over classical education
"julian's successors jovian, valentinian i, and valens continued julian's policy of religious toleration within the empire, garnering them both praise from pagan writers"
official persecution of paganism in the eastern empire began under theodosius i in 381 ad
"theodosius strictly enforced anti-pagan laws, had priesthoods disbanded, temples destroyed, and actively participated in christian actions against pagan holy sites"
"he enacted laws that prohibited worship of pagan gods not only in public, but also within private homes"
"the last olympic games were held in 393 ad, and theodosius likely suppressed any further attempts to hold the games"
"western empire emperor gratian, under the influence of his adviser ambrose, ended the widespread, unofficial tolerance that had existed in the western roman empire since the reign of julian"
"in 382 ad, gratian appropriated the income and property of the remaining orders of pagan priests, disbanded the vestal virgins, removed altars, and confiscated temples"
"despite official suppression by the roman government, worship of the greco-roman gods persisted in some rural and remote regions into the early middle ages"
"a claimed temple to apollo, with a community of worshipers and associated sacred grove, survived at monte cassino until 529 ad, when it was forcefully converted to a christian chapel by saint benedict of nursia, who destroyed the altar and cut down the grove"
"other pagan communities, namely the maniots, persisted in the mani peninsula of greece until at least the 9th century"
"greek religion and philosophy have experienced a number of revivals, firstly in the arts, humanities and spirituality of renaissance neoplatonism, which many believed had effects in the real world"
"during the period  when ancient greek literature and philosophy gained widespread appreciation in europe, this new popularity did not extend to ancient greek religion, especially the original theist forms, and most new examinations of greek philosophy were written in a solidly christian context"
"early revivalists, with varying degrees of commitment, were the englishmen john fransham , interested in neoplatonism, and thomas taylor , who produced the first english translations of many neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts"
"more recently, a revival has begun with contemporary hellenism, as it is often called. in greece, the term is hellenic ethnic religion"
"in greece, the term is hellenic ethnic religion . modern hellenism reflects neoplatonic and platonic speculation , as well as classical cult practice"
but it has far fewer followers than greek orthodox christianity.
