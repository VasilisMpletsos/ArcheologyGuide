"they invade his temple, and he drives them away. he says that the matter should be brought before athena"
"apollo promises to protect orestes, as orestes has become apollo's supplicant"
"apollo advocates orestes at the trial, and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo. the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks"
"as a quintessentially greek god, apollo had no direct roman equivalent, although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus"
there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus
"on the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s bce, apollo's first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the ""apollinare"""

"according to greek tradition, he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy"
"however, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars"
"in this interpretation, apollo's title of lykegenes can simply be read as ""born in lycia"", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves"
"in literary contexts, apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder"
the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian
"however, the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea, he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus"
this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase. apollo is often associated with the golden mean
apollo is often associated with the golden mean. this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony
"in antiquity, apollo was associated with the planet mercury"
"the ancient greeks believed that mercury as observed during the morning was a different planet than the one during the evening, because each twilight mercury would appear farther from the sun as it set than it had the night before"

apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance
"the earliest greek word for a statue is ""delight"" , and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision"
maurice bowra notices that the greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined
"the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought"
the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity
"the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment"
the statues of apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength
"""in the balance and relation of their limbs, such figures express their whole character, mental and physical, and reveal their central being"
",the radiant reality of youth in its heyday"""
"numerous free-standing statues of male youths from archaic greece exist, and were once thought to be representations of apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals"
"in 1895, v. i"
leonardos proposed the term kouros  to refer to those from keratea; this usage was later expanded by henri lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format
the earliest examples of life-sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos
"such statues were found across the greek-speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios, boeotia alone"
significantly more rare are the life-sized bronze statues
"one of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as ""a miracle"" by ernst homann-wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze, piraeus apollo"
"it was found in piraeus, a port city close to athens, and is believed to have come from north-eastern peloponnesus"
it is the only surviving large-scale peloponnesian statue
"the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara, a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre, in his left arm"
"while none of the greek originals have survived, several roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist, of which an example is the apollo barberini"
"apollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a cithara  or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree"
"the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans, from the renaissance through the 19th century"
"the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares, made between 330 and 320 bce"
"the life-size so-called ""adonis"" found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars"
"in the late 2nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem, roman thysdrus, he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo, though now even a god's divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak, a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire"
"another haloed apollo in mosaic, from hadrumentum, is in the museum at sousse"
"the conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century bce to depict alexander the great"
"some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed"
"apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music, dance and poetry"
dance and music apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture
"percy bysshe shelley composed a ""hymn of apollo"" , and the god's instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinsky's apollon musagète"
"in 1978, the canadian band rush released an album with songs ""apollo: bringer of wisdom""/""dionysus: bringer of love"""
"books apollo has been portrayed in modern literature, such as when charles handy, in gods of management  uses greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture"
"apollo represents a 'role' culture where order, reason, and bureaucracy prevail"
"in 2016, author rick riordan published the first book in the trials of apollo series, publishing four other books in the series in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020"
"film apollo has been depicted in modern films—for instance, by keith david in the 1997 animated feature film hercules, by luke evans in the 2010 action film clash of the titans, and by dimitri lekkos in the 2010 film percy jackson & the olympians: the lightning thief"
video games apollo has appeared in many modern video games
apollo appears as a minor character in santa monica studio's 2010 action-adventure game god of war iii with his bow being used by peirithous
he also appears in the 2014 hi-rez studios multiplayer online battle arena game smite as a playable character
"in the philosophical discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses, where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity"
archaic greece was the period in greek history lasting from c
"800 bc to the second persian invasion of greece in 480 bc, following the greek dark ages and succeeded by the classical period"
"in the archaic period, greeks settled across the mediterranean and the black seas, as far as marseille in the west and trapezus  in the east; and by the end of the archaic period, they were part of a trade network that spanned the entire mediterranean"
the archaic period began with a massive increase in the greek population and of significant changes that rendered the greek world at the end of the 8th century entirely unrecognizable from its beginning
"according to anthony snodgrass, the archaic period was bounded by two revolutions in the greek world"
"it began with a ""structural revolution"" that ""drew the political map of the greek world"" and established the poleis, the distinctively greek city-states, and it ended with the intellectual revolution of the classical period"
"the archaic period saw developments in greek politics, economics, international relations, warfare and culture"
"it laid the groundwork for the classical period, both politically and culturally"
"it was in the archaic period that the greek alphabet developed, the earliest surviving greek literature was composed, monumental sculpture and red-figure pottery began in greece and the hoplite became the core of greek armies"
"in athens, the earliest institutions of democracy were implemented under solon, and the reforms of cleisthenes at the end of the archaic period brought in athenian democracy as it was during the classical period"
"in sparta, many of the institutions credited to the reforms of lycurgus were introduced during the archaic period, the region of messenia was brought under spartan control, helotage was introduced and the peloponnesian league was founded and made sparta a dominant power in greece"
"the word archaic derives from the greek word archaios, meaning 'old', and refers to the period in ancient greek history before the classical period"
"the archaic period is generally considered to have lasted from the beginning of the 8th century bc until the beginning of the 5th century bc, with the foundation of the olympic games in 776 bc and the second persian invasion of greece in 480 bc forming notional starting and ending dates"
the archaic period was long considered to have been less important and historically interesting than the classical period and was studied primarily as a precursor to it
"more recently, archaic greece has come to be studied for its own achievements"
"with this reassessment of the significance of the archaic period, some scholars have objected to the term archaic because of its connotations in english of being primitive and outdated"
"no term which has been suggested to replace it has gained widespread currency, however, and the term is still in use"
"much evidence about the classical period of ancient greece comes from written histories, such as thucydides's history of the peloponnesian war"
"by contrast, no such evidence survives from the archaic period"
surviving contemporary written accounts of life in the period are in the form of poetry
"other written sources from the archaic period include epigraphical evidence, including parts of law codes, inscriptions on votive offerings and epigrams inscribed on tombs"
"however, none of that evidence is in the quantity for which it survives from the classical period"
what is lacking in written evidence is made up for in the rich archaeological evidence from the archaic greek world
"indeed, although much knowledge of classical greek art comes from later roman copies, all surviving archaic greek art is original"
other sources for the archaic period are the traditions recorded by later greek writers such as herodotus
"however, those traditions are not part of any form of history that would be recognised today"
those transmitted by herodotus were recorded whether or not he believed them to be accurate
"indeed, herodotus did not even record any dates before 480 bc"
"politically, the archaic period saw the development of the polis  as the predominant unit of political organisation"
"many cities throughout greece came under the rule of autocratic leaders, called ""tyrants"""
"it also saw the development of law and systems of communal decision-making, with the earliest evidence for law codes and constitutional structures dating to the period"
"by the end of the archaic period, both the athenian and spartan constitutions seem to have developed into their classical forms"
the archaic period saw significant urbanisation and the development of the concept of the polis as it was used in classical greece
"by solon's time, if not before, the word polis had acquired its classical meaning, and though the emergence of the polis as a political community was still in progress at this point, the polis as an urban centre was a product of the eighth century"
"however, the polis did not become the dominant form of socio-political organisation throughout greece in the archaic period, and in the north and west of the country it did not become dominant until some way into the classical period"
"the urbanisation process in archaic greece known as ""synoecism"" – the amalgamation of several small settlements into a single urban centre – took place in much of greece in the eighth century bc"
"both athens and argos, for instance, began to coalesce into single settlements around the end of that century"
"in some settlements, this physical unification was marked by the construction of defensive city walls, as was the case in smyrna by the middle of the eighth century bc, and corinth by the middle of the seventh century bc"
"it seems that the evolution of the polis as a socio-political structure, rather than a simply geographical one, can be attributed to this urbanisation, as well as a significant population increase in the eighth century"
"these two factors created a need for a new form of political organisation, as the political systems in place at the beginning of the archaic period quickly became unworkable"
"athens though in the early part of the classical period the city of athens was both culturally and politically dominant, it was not until the late sixth century bc that it became a leading power in greece"
"the attempted coup by cylon of athens  may be the earliest event in athenian history which is clearly attested by ancient sources, dating to around 636 bce"
"at this time, it seems that athens' monarchy had already ended and the archonship had replaced it as the most important executive office in the state, though the archonship could only be held by members of the eupatridae, the families which made up athens' aristocracy"
"the earliest laws of athens were established by draco, in 621/0; his law on homicide was the only one to have survived to the classical period"
draco's law code aimed to replace private revenge as the first and only response of an individual to an offence committed against them
"the law code of draco, however, failed to prevent the tensions between the rich and poor which were the impetus to solon's reforms"
"in 594/3 bc, solon was appointed ""archon and mediator"". exactly what his reforms consisted of is uncertain"
"he claimed to have taken up the horoi to set the land free, but the exact meaning of horoi is unknown; their removal seems to have been part of the problem of hektemoroi – another word whose meaning is obscure"
"solon was also credited with abolishing slavery for debtors, and establishing limits on who could be granted athenian citizenship"
"solon instituted radical constitutional reform, replacing noble birth as a qualification for office with income"
"the poorest – called thetes – could hold no offices, although they could attend the assembly and the law courts, while the richest class – the pentacosiomedimni – were the only people eligible to become treasurer, and possibly archon"
"he set up the council of the four hundred, responsible for discussing motions which were to come before the assembly"
"finally, solon substantially reduced the powers of the archon by giving citizens the right of appeal; their case was judged by the assembly"
a second wave of constitutional reform in athens was instituted by cleisthenes towards the end of the sixth century
"cleisthenes apparently redivided the athenian population, which had previously been grouped into four tribes, into ten new tribes"
"a new council of 500 was instituted, with members from each deme represented"
demes were also given the power to determine their own members  and to somewhat determine their own judicial arrangements
these reforms gave the citizen body a sense of responsibility for what happened in the community for the first time
"between the reforms of solon and cleisthenes, the athenian constitution had become identifiably democratic"
sparta sparta's constitution took on the form it would have in the classical period during the eighth century bc
"by the classical period, spartan tradition attributed this constitution to lycurgus of sparta, who according to thucydides lived a little over four centuries before the end of the peloponnesian war, around the end of the ninth century"
"the first messenian war, probably taking place from approximately 740 to 720 bc, saw the strengthening of the powers of the gerousia against the assembly, and the enslavement of the messenian population as helots"
"around the same time, the ephors gained the power to restrict the actions of the kings of sparta"
"thus by the late seventh century, sparta's constitution had recognisably taken on its classical form"
"from around 560 bc, sparta began to build a series of alliances with other greek states, which became the peloponnesian league: by 550, cities such as elis, corinth, and megara were part of the alliance"
"this series of alliances had the dual purpose of preventing the cities of the league from supporting the helot population of messenia, and of helping sparta in its conflict with argos, which in the archaic period was along with sparta one of the major powers in the peloponnese"
"in the eighth and seventh centuries bc, greeks began to spread across the mediterranean, the sea of marmara and the black sea"
"this was not simply for trade, but also to found settlements"
"these greek colonies were not, as roman colonies were, dependent on their mother-city, but were independent city-states in their own right"
"greeks settled outside of greece in two distinct ways. the first was in permanent settlements founded by greeks, which formed as independent poleis"
the second form was in what historians refer to as emporia; trading posts which were occupied by both greeks and non-greeks and which were primarily concerned with the manufacture and sale of goods
examples of this latter type of settlement are found at al mina in the east and pithekoussai in the west.the earliest greek colonies were on sicily
"many of these were founded by people from chalcis, but other greek states, such as corinth and megara were also responsible for early colonies in the area"
"by the end of the eighth century bc, greek settlements in southern italy were also well established"
"in the seventh century, greek colonists expanded the areas that they settled. in the west, colonies were founded as far afield as marseilles"
"in the east, the north aegean, the sea of marmara, and the black sea all saw colonies founded. the dominant coloniser in these parts was miletus"
"at the same time, early colonies such as syracuse and megara hyblaea began to themselves establish colonies"
"in the west, sicily and southern italy were some of the largest recipients of greek colonisers"
"so many greek settlements were founded in southern italy that it was known in antiquity as magna graecia – ""great greece"""
"in the last quarter of the eighth century, new greek settlements were founded in sicily and southern italy at an average rate of one every other year, and greek colonists continued to found cities in italy until the mid-fifth century bc"
"archaic greece from the mid-seventh century bc has sometimes been called an ""age of tyrants"""
"the word τύραννος  first appeared in greek literature in a poem of archilochus, to describe the lydian ruler gyges"
"the earliest greek tyrant was cypselus, who seized power in corinth in a coup in 655 bc"
"he was followed by a series of others in the mid-seventh century bc, such as orthagoras in sicyon and theagenes in megara"
various explanations have been provided for the rise of tyranny in the seventh century bc
"the most popular of these explanations dates back to aristotle, who argued that tyrants were set up by the people in response to the nobility becoming less tolerable"
"as there is no evidence from the time that the nobility were becoming increasingly arrogant during the period, modern explanations of seventh century tyranny have tried to find other reasons for unrest among the people"
"for example, robert drews argues that tyrannies were set up by individuals who controlled private armies and that early tyrants did not need the support of the people at all, whilst n"
g.l
"hammond suggests that tyrannies were established as a consequence of in-fighting between rival oligarchs, rather than between the oligarchs and the people"
"recently historians have begun to question the existence of a seventh century ""age of tyrants"""
"in the archaic period, the greek word tyrannos, according to victor parker, did not have the negative connotations it had gained by the time aristotle wrote his constitution of the athenians"
"when archilochus used the word tyrant, it was synonymous with anax"
"parker dates the first use of the word tyrannos in a negative context to the first half of the sixth century, at least fifty years after cypselus took power in corinth"
it was not until the time of thucydides that tyrannos and basileus  were consistently distinguished
"similarly, greg anderson has argued that archaic greek tyrants were not considered illegitimate rulers, and cannot be distinguished from any other rulers of the same period"
"the greek population doubled during the eighth century, resulting in more and larger settlements than previously"
"the largest settlements, such as athens and knossos, might have had populations of 1,500 in 1000 bc; by 700 they might have held as many as 5,000 people"
"this was part of a wider phenomenon of population growth across the mediterranean region at this time, which may have been caused by a climatic shift that took place between 850 and 750, which made the region cooler and wetter"
this led to the expansion of population into uncultivated areas of greece and was probably also a driver for colonisation abroad
"ancient sources give us little information on mortality rates in archaic greece, but it is likely that not many more than half of the population survived to the age of 18: perinatal and infant mortality are likely to have been very high"
the population of archaic greece would have consequently been very young – somewhere between two-fifths and two-thirds of the population might have been under 18
"by contrast, probably less than one in four people were over 40, and only one in 20 over the age of 60"
"evidence from human remains shows that the average age at death increased over the archaic period, but there is no clear trend for other measures of health"
"the size of houses gives some evidence for prosperity within society; in the eighth and seventh centuries, the average house size remained constant around 45–50 m2, but the number of very large and very small houses increased, indicating increasing economic inequality"
"from the end of the seventh century, this trend reversed, with houses clustering closely around a growing average, and by the end of the archaic period the average house size had risen to about 125 m2"
not all arable land in greece was yet under cultivation in the archaic period
"farms appear to have been small, cohesive units, concentrated near settlements"
"they were highly diversified, growing a wide variety of crops simultaneously, in order to make consistent use of human resources throughout the year and to ensure that the failure of any one crop was not too much of a disaster"
"crop rotation was practiced, with fields left fallow every other year"
"though wheat was preferred, in some parts of greece barley was the staple grain; where wheat was grown it was durum rather than bread wheat"
"alongside these, farmers cultivated pulses, vines, olives, fruit, and vegetables"
"olives and grapes, which could be turned into oil and wine respectively, served as cash crops; farmers who cultivated land near population centres could also sell soft fruits and leafy vegetables at market"
livestock were of secondary importance
"sheep and goats, in particular, were kept for meat, milk, wool, and fertiliser, but they were difficult to sustain and large herds were a sign of exceptional wealth"
a team of oxen could increase agricultural output significantly but were expensive to maintain
"as they had in the dark ages, the wealthiest members of greek society could own large herds of cattle"
this pattern had probably developed before the beginning of the period and remained relatively consistent throughout it
the idea that it was preceded by a period of pastoralism and that agriculture only became dominant in the course of the archaic period is not supported by the archaeological or literary evidence
"no technological innovations in agriculture appear to have occurred, except possibly the increased use of iron tools and more intensive use of manure"
"the main source for the practice of agriculture in the period is hesiod's works and days, which gives the impression of very small subsistence holdings in which the owner performed most of the labour personally; close reading reveals that much of the produce is to be sold for profit, much of the work to be performed by slaves , and much of the owner's time to be spent away from the farm"
"slaves' labour was supplemented by labourers who worked for a wage, as sharecroppers , or to pay off debts; this practice seems to have increased in the eighth century as the growth of the population increased the number of workers available, and intensified in the seventh century with the development of legally enforced debts and the status of the labourers increasingly becoming a source of social strife"
"by the late eighth century bc, the archaic greek world had become involved in an active trade network around the aegean"
it was this trade network that was the source of the orientalizing influence on greek art in the early part of the archaic period
"meanwhile, to the west, trade between corinth and magna graecia in southern italy and sicily was booming"
"the eastern trade mainly involved the greek islands, with aegina, for instance, acting as an intermediary between the east and the greek mainland"
east greek states would go on to become extremely prosperous through the sixth century due to the trade with asia and egypt
"of the mainland cities, those on the coast were the biggest recipients of trade from the east, especially corinth"
"in the early part of the archaic period, athens does not seem to have been particularly actively involved in this eastern trade, and very few examples of eastern imports have been found in athens from the eighth or early seventh centuries"
"by contrast, nearby euboea had trade-links with the east as early as the first half of the eighth century, and the earliest pottery from the greek islands found at al mina in modern syria is from euboea"
"by the sixth century, greece was part of a trade network spanning the entire mediterranean"
"sixth century laconian pottery has been found as far afield as marseilles and carthage to the west, crete to the south and sardis to the east"
"at the beginning of the archaic period, coinage had not yet been invented"
"the greeks measured the value of objects or fines using certain valuable objects, such as oxen, tripods, and metal spits, as units of account"
"as in the near east, precious metal bullion was used as a medium of exchange, principally gold at first, but mainly silver by the beginning of the sixth century"
"the weight of this bullion  was measured using standard units, named for their value in terms of metal spits  and handfuls  of metal spits; these terms would later be used as names for greek coin denominations"
coinage was invented in lydia around 650 bc
"it was quickly adopted by greek communities in western asia minor, although the older system of bullion remained in use as well"
"the island of aegina began to issue its distinctive ""turtle"" coins before 550 bc, and from there coinage spread to athens, corinth and the cycladic islands in the 540s bc, southern italy and sicily before 525 bc, and thrace before 514 bc"
"most of these coinages were very small and were mostly only used within the community that issued them, but the ""turtles"" of aegina  and the ""owls"" of athens  were issued in great quantity and exported throughout the greek world"
"the images on coins initially changed rapidly, but increasingly each community settled on a single image or set of images"
"some of these were the symbol or image of an important deity in the city or visual puns on the city's name, but in many cases their meaning is obscure and may not have been chosen for any special reason"
"the reasons for the rapid and widespread adoption of coinage by the greeks are not entirely clear and several possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, have been suggested"
one possibility is the increased ease of commerce which coinage allowed
"coins were of standardised weights, which meant that their value could be determined without weighing them"
"furthermore, it was not necessary for users of coinage to spend time determining whether the silver was pure silver; the fact that the coin had been issued by the community was a promise that it was worth a set value"
"another possibility is that coinage was adopted specifically to enable communities to make payments to their citizens, mercenaries and artisans in a transparent, fair and efficient way"
"similarly, when wealthy members of the community were required to contribute wealth to the community for festivals and the equipment of navies, coinage made the process more efficient and transparent"
"a third possibility, that coinage was adopted as an expression of a community's independence and identity, seems to be anachronistic"
"in the visual arts, the archaic period is characterised by a shift towards representational and naturalistic styles"
"it was the period in which monumental sculpture was introduced to greece, and in which greek pottery styles went through great changes, from the repeating patterns of the late geometric period to the earliest red-figure vases"
"the early part of the archaic period saw distinctive orientalizing influences, both in pottery and in sculpture"
"sculpture at the beginning of the archaic period, greek sculpture mostly consisted of small bronze works, particularly of horses"
"bronze human figures were also produced, and both horse and human figures are primarily found in religious sanctuaries"
"towards the end of the eighth century, horse figurines became much less common, disappearing ""almost completely"" by 700 bc"
"in the seventh century, greek sculpture saw a strong eastern influence, with mythical creatures such as griffins and sirens becoming much more popular"
"also in the seventh century bc, greek sculpture began to directly represent gods, a practice which had disappeared after the end of the mycenaean period"
life-size human sculpture in hard stone began in greece in the archaic period
this was inspired in part by ancient egyptian stone sculpture: the proportions of the new york kouros exactly correspond to egyptian rules about the proportion of human figures
"in greece, these sculptures best survive as religious dedications and grave markers, but the same techniques would have also been used to make cult images"
"the best-known types of archaic sculpture are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues of a young man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century bc in the cyclades"
"probably the earliest kore produced was the dedication of nikandre, which was dedicated to artemis at her temple on delos between 660 and 650 bc, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this"
kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities
"some kouroi, such as the colossus of the naxians from around 600 bc, are known to represent apollo, while the phrasikleia kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked"
"over the course of the sixth century, kouroi from attica become more lifelike and naturalistic"
"however, this trend does not appear elsewhere in the greek world"
"the genre began to become less common over the last part of the sixth century as the elites who commissioned kouroi declined in influence, and by around 480 kouroi were no longer made"
pottery the period saw a shift in the decoration of greek pottery from abstract to figurative styles
"during the greek dark ages, following the fall of the mycenaean civilisation, greek pottery decoration had been based around increasingly elaborate geometrical patterns"
"human figures first appeared on greek pots in crete in the early part of the ninth century bc, but did not become common on mainland greek pottery until the middle of the eighth century bc"
"the eighth century saw the development of the orientalizing style, which signalled a shift away from the earlier geometric style and the accumulation of influences derived from phoenicia and syria"
this orientalizing influence seems to have come from goods imported to greece from the near east
"at the beginning of the seventh century bc, vase painters in corinth began to develop the black-figure style"
"at the same time, potters began to use incisions in the clay of vases in order to draw outlines and interior detailing"
"this adoption of incision, probably taken from eastern metalwork, allowed potters to show fine details of their decorations"
"as the archaic period drew to a close, red-figure pottery was invented in athens, with the first examples being produced about 525 bc, probably by the andokides painter"
the invention of the red-figure technique in athens came at around the same time as the development of other techniques such as the white ground technique and six's technique
the earliest extant greek literature comes from the archaic period. poetry was the predominant form of literature in the period
"alongside the dominant lyric and epic traditions, tragedy began to develop in the archaic period, borrowing elements from the pre-existing genres of archaic greek poetry"
by the sixth century bc the first written prose in greek literature appeared
"writing after the end of the mycenaean period, the art of writing was lost in greece: by the ninth century probably no greeks understood the bronze age linear b writing system"
"from the ninth century bc objects inscribed with phoenician writing began to be brought into the greek world, and it was from this phoenician script that the greek alphabet developed in the eighth century bc"
"by the middle of the eighth century bc, pottery inscribed in greek begins to occur in the archaeological record"
the earliest known inscriptions in greek tend to identify or explain the object on which they are inscribed
"possibly the earliest known greek inscription is found on a jug from the first half of the eighth century bc, discovered in osteria dell'osa in latium"
"most early inscriptions were written in verse, though some from ionia were in prose, influenced by the prose traditions of ionia's eastern neighbours"
"from the beginning of the seventh century, curses and dedications began to be inscribed on objects, and by the sixth century, surviving inscriptions include public records such as law codes, lists of officials, and records of treaties"
"poetry greek literature in the archaic period was predominantly poetry, though the earliest prose dates to the sixth century bc"
"archaic poetry was primarily intended to be performed rather than read, and can be broadly divided into three categories: lyric, rhapsodic, and citharodic"
the performance of the poetry could either be private  or public
"though there would certainly have been a pre-existing literary tradition in greece, the earliest surviving works are by homer"
"homer's poetry, though it dates to around the time that the greeks developed writing, would have been composed orally – the earliest surviving poetry to have certainly been composed in writing is that of archilochus, from the mid-seventh century bc"
"in contrast with the classical period, in which the literary culture of athens dominated the greek world, the archaic poetic tradition was geographically spread out"
"sappho and alcaeus, for instance, were from lesbos, while pindar came from thebes, and alcman from sparta"
"the beginnings of greek tragedy also have their roots in the archaic period, though the exact history is obscure"
the competition in tragedy at the great dionysia began in the 530s bc
"aristotle believed that early tragedy developed from the dithyramb, a choral hymn to dionysius; by ancient tradition the development from dithyramb to tragedy was ascribed to thespis"
evidence from linear b tablets shows that the gods worshipped in archaic and classical greece shared names with those worshipped by their mycenaean predecessors
"however, the practice of religion changed significantly in the archaic period"
"the most significant change of the eighth century was the development of permanent temples as a regular feature of sanctuary sites, where in the dark ages there had probably been no building specifically used for cult purposes"
"in the seventh century, this development of temples continued with the appearance of the first monumental stone temple buildings, beginning with the temple of apollo at corinth"
these temples were probably built to house cult statues of the god
"except on crete, where there may have been a continuous tradition of cult statues from the mycenaean period, these cult images were a new development in greek religion – there is no evidence that greek dark age cult on the mainland used cult images"
along with the introduction of temples came an increase in the number of dedications at cult sites
"in the seventh century, the number of surviving dedications decreases again, but there is also a marked change in the character of dedications, from the figurines of animals common in the eighth century to human figurines"
"in the eighth century, some sanctuaries – for instance at olympia – begin to attract dedications from outside the local area"
"olympia the sanctuary of zeus at olympia had been a cult site in the dark ages, with dedications there dating back to the tenth century bc, but the eighth century saw an explosion in the number of dedications: 160 animal figurines are known from the 9th century, compared to 1,461 from the 8th"
bronze tripods and jewellery have also been discovered as dedications at archaic olympia
"though most of the dedications from the 8th century were manufactured in the peloponnese, dedications also came from attica, and even as far afield as italy and the eastern mediterranean"
this enormous explosion in cultic activity in olympia apparently coincides with the establishment of the olympic games as a major event
"according to greek tradition the first games at olympia had been established by herakles, but these had fallen out of practice until they were revived in 776 bc"
"delphi delphi, on the slopes of mount parnassus, had been continuously occupied from the bronze age, but the first evidence of a sanctuary there dates to the eighth century bc when dedicatory bronze tripods and votive figurines begin to appear in the archaeological record"
"in the last quarter of the eighth century, the number of offerings at delphi significantly increased, and there is evidence that these offerings were beginning to come from across greece"
this pan-hellenic interest in the sanctuary at delphi was presumably driven by the development of the oracle there
"funerary practices the archaic period saw a series of changes in greek funerary practices, with a significant increase in the diversity of greek burial practice"
"in athens, the dark age practice had been to cremate adults and then bury the remains in a pottery vessel, along with pottery and metal grave goods"
"soon after 800 bc, burial superseded cremation as the primary way of disposing of adult bodies, and grave goods declined in both quantity and quality; at the same time, the pots used as grave markers became significantly more elaborate"
"by the last third of the century, children and adults began to be buried together"
grave goods began to be left in trenches specifically for offerings which were separate from the graves themselves
"around 700 bc, athens changed from inhumation back to cremation – but this time, cremation in the grave rather than on a separate pyre"
"also around 700 bc, burial in athens was almost entirely confined to specific cemeteries outside of the settlement"
"other settlements outside of athens also saw a move to burial only in areas reserved for the purpose, though this was not a new development in crete and several aegean islands"
"some other mainland cities, such as argos and corinth, also saw a reduction in grave goods"
"in athens in the sixth century, solon passed laws restricting the extravagance of funerals, and similar restrictions were also implemented at gortyn, mytilene, and sparta"
"the archaic period saw the beginning of philosophical and scientific thinking in greece, and the greeks' interaction with other cultures from italy, egypt, and the near east in this period had a significant impact on their thought"
"in the archaic period, the boundaries between disciplines had not yet developed, and so the thinkers who were later identified as philosophers also engaged in practical pursuits: andrea nightingale describes them as ""pragmatic and polymathic"""
"for instance, ancient traditions about thales of miletus, traditionally identified as the first philosopher, also show his skill in such diverse fields as astronomy, engineering, politics, agriculture, and commerce"
"in the archaic period, the most significant military development was the adoption of hoplite warfare by the greek states"
this occurred in the early part of the seventh century bc
"the panoply, or hoplite's armour, began to appear in the eighth century; the earliest known example comes from argos in the late eighth century"
"though the pieces which made up the panoply were all in use in greece by the end of the eighth century, the earliest evidence for it being worn as a complete set of armour does not come until around 675 bc, where it is depicted on a corinthian vase painting"
"the phalanx tactics which were used by hoplites in the classical period seem to have been adopted in the mid-seventh century; before this point, the older style of combat in which spears were thrown at the enemy before closing quarters was still used"
"in the naval sphere, the archaic period saw the development of the trireme in greece"
"in the eighth century, greek navies began to use bireme ships with two banks of oars, and the three banked trireme seems to have become popular in the seventh century"
"in classical antiquity, the hellenistic period covers the time in mediterranean history after classical greece, between the death of alexander the great in 323 bc to the death of cleopatra vii  followed by the emergence of the roman empire, as signified by the battle of actium in 31 bc and the conquest of ptolemaic egypt the following year"
"the ancient greek word hellas  was gradually recognized as the name for greece, from which the word hellenistic was derived"
"""hellenistic"" is distinguished from ""hellenic"" in that the latter refers to greece itself, while the former encompasses all ancient territories under greek influence, in particular the east after the conquests of alexander the great"
"after the macedonian conquest of the achaemenid empire in 330 bc and its disintegration shortly after, the hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west asia , north-east africa  and south asia"
"this resulted in an influx of greek colonists and the export of greek culture and language to these new realms, spanning as far as modern-day india"
"these new kingdoms were also influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient"
"hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the ancient greek world with that of western asian, northeastern african, and southwestern asian"
"this mixture gave rise to a common attic-based greek dialect, known as koine greek, which became the lingua franca throughout the ancient world"
"during the hellenistic period, greek cultural influence and power reached its peak in the mediterranean and beyond"
"prosperity and progress in the arts, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science characterize the era"
"the hellenistic period saw the rise of new comedy, alexandrian poetry, translation efforts such as the septuagint, and the philosophies of stoicism, epicureanism, and pyrrhonism"
"in science, the works of the mathematician euclid and the polymath archimedes are exemplary"
"the religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the greco-egyptian serapis, eastern deities such as attis and cybele, and a syncretism between hellenistic culture and buddhism in bactria and northwest india"
scholars and historians are divided as to which event signals the end of the hellenistic era
"proposals include the final conquest of the greek heartlands by rome in 146 bc following the achaean war, the final defeat of the ptolemaic kingdom at the battle of actium in 31 bc, and the move by roman emperor constantine the great of the capital of the roman empire to constantinople in ad 330"
"angelos chaniotis ends the hellenistic period with the death of hadrian in 138 ad, who integrated the greeks fully into the roman empire, though a range from c"
"321 bc to 256 ad may also be given. the word originated from ancient greek ἑλληνιστής , from ἑλλάς ; as if ""hellenist"" + ""ic"""
"the idea of a hellenistic period is a 19th-century concept, and did not exist in ancient greece. although words related in form or meaning, e.g"
"hellenist , have been attested since ancient times, it was johann gustav droysen in the mid-19th century, who in his classic work geschichte des hellenismus , coined the term hellenistic to refer to and define the period when greek culture spread in the non-greek world after alexander's conquest"
"following droysen, hellenistic and related terms, e.g"
"hellenism, have been widely used in various contexts; a notable such use is in culture and anarchy by matthew arnold, where hellenism is used in contrast with hebraism"
"the major issue with the term hellenistic lies in its convenience, as the spread of greek culture was not the generalized phenomenon that the term implies"
some areas of the conquered world were more affected by greek influences than others
"the term hellenistic also implies that the greek populations were of majority in the areas in which they settled, but in many cases, the greek settlers were actually the minority among the native populations"
"the greek population and the native population did not always mix; the greeks moved and brought their own culture, but interaction did not always occur"
"while a few fragments exist, there are no complete surviving historical works that date to the hundred years following alexander's death"
"the works of the major hellenistic historians hieronymus of cardia , duris of samos and phylarchus, which were used by surviving sources, are all lost"
"the earliest and most credible surviving source for the hellenistic period is polybius of megalopolis , a statesman of the achaean league until 168 bc when he was forced to go to rome as a hostage"
"his histories eventually grew to a length of forty books, covering the years 220 to 167 bc"
"the most important source after polybius is diodorus siculus who wrote his bibliotheca historica between 60 and 30 bc and reproduced some important earlier sources such as hieronymus, but his account of the hellenistic period breaks off after the battle of ipsus"
"another important source, plutarch's  parallel lives although more preoccupied with issues of personal character and morality, outlines the history of important hellenistic figures"
appian of alexandria  wrote a history of the roman empire that includes information of some hellenistic kingdoms
"other sources include justin's  epitome of pompeius trogus' historiae philipicae and a summary of arrian's events after alexander, by photios i of constantinople"
"lesser supplementary sources include curtius rufus, pausanias, pliny, and the byzantine encyclopedia the suda"
"in the field of philosophy, diogenes laërtius' lives and opinions of eminent philosophers is the main source; works such as cicero's de natura deorum also provide some further detail of philosophical schools in the hellenistic period"
ancient greece had traditionally been a fractious collection of fiercely independent city-states
"after the peloponnesian war , greece had fallen under a spartan hegemony, in which sparta was pre-eminent but not all-powerful"
"spartan hegemony was succeeded by a theban hegemony after the battle of leuctra , but after the battle of mantinea , all of greece was so weakened that no one state could claim pre-eminence"
"it was against this backdrop that the ascendancy of macedon began, under king philip ii"
"macedon was located at the periphery of the greek world, and although its royal family claimed greek descent, the macedonians themselves were looked down upon as semi-barbaric by the rest of the greeks"
"however, macedon controlled a large area and had a relatively strong centralized government, in comparison to most greek states"
philip ii was a strong and expansionist king who took every opportunity to expand macedonian territory. in 352 bc he annexed thessaly and magnesia
"in 338 bc, philip defeated a combined theban and athenian army at the battle of chaeronea after a decade of desultory conflict"
"in the aftermath, philip formed the league of corinth, effectively bringing the majority of greece under his direct sway"
"he was elected hegemon of the league, and a campaign against the achaemenid empire of persia was planned"
"however in 336 bc, while this campaign was in its early stages, he was assassinated"
"succeeding his father, alexander took over the persian war himself"
"during a decade of campaigning, alexander conquered the whole persian empire, overthrowing the persian king darius iii"
"the conquered lands included asia minor, assyria, the levant, egypt, mesopotamia, media, persia, and parts of modern-day afghanistan, pakistan, and the steppes of central asia"
"the years of constant campaigning had taken their toll however, and alexander died in 323 bc"
"after his death, the huge territories alexander had conquered became subject to a strong greek influence  for the next two or three centuries, until the rise of rome in the west, and of parthia in the east"
"as the greek and levantine cultures mingled, the development of a hybrid hellenistic culture began, and persisted even when isolated from the main centres of greek culture"
it can be argued that some of the changes across the macedonian empire after alexander's conquests and during the rule of the diadochi would have occurred without the influence of greek rule
"as mentioned by peter green, numerous factors of conquest have been merged under the term hellenistic period"
"specific areas conquered by alexander's invading army, including egypt and areas of asia minor and mesopotamia ""fell"" willingly to conquest and viewed alexander as more of a liberator than a conqueror"
"in addition, much of the area conquered would continue to be ruled by the diadochi, alexander's generals and successors"
"initially the whole empire was divided among them; however, some territories were lost relatively quickly, or only remained nominally under macedonian rule"
"after 200 years, only much reduced and rather degenerate states remained, until the conquest of ptolemaic egypt by rome"
"when alexander the great died , he left behind a sprawling empire which was composed of many essentially autonomous territories called satraps"
without a chosen successor there were immediate disputes among his generals as to who should be king of macedon
these generals became known as the diadochi
"meleager and the infantry supported the candidacy of alexander's half-brother, philip arrhidaeus, while perdiccas, the leading cavalry commander, supported waiting until the birth of alexander's child by roxana"
"after the infantry stormed the palace of babylon, a compromise was arranged – arrhidaeus  should become king and should rule jointly with roxana's child, assuming that it was a boy"
"perdiccas himself would become regent  of the empire, and meleager his lieutenant"
"soon, however, perdiccas had meleager and the other infantry leaders murdered and assumed full control"
"the generals who had supported perdiccas were rewarded in the partition of babylon by becoming satraps of the various parts of the empire, but perdiccas' position was shaky, because, as arrian writes, ""everyone was suspicious of him, and he of them"""
the first of the diadochi wars broke out when perdiccas planned to marry alexander's sister cleopatra and began to question antigonus i monophthalmus' leadership in asia minor
"antigonus fled for greece, and then, together with antipater and craterus  invaded anatolia"
"the rebels were supported by lysimachus, the satrap of thrace and ptolemy, the satrap of egypt"
"although eumenes, satrap of cappadocia, defeated the rebels in asia minor, perdiccas himself was murdered by his own generals peithon, seleucus, and antigenes  during his invasion of egypt"
"ptolemy came to terms with perdiccas's murderers, making peithon and arrhidaeus regents in his place, but soon these came to a new agreement with antipater at the treaty of triparadisus"
"antipater was made regent of the empire, and the two kings were moved to macedon"
"antigonus remained in charge of asia minor, ptolemy retained egypt, lysimachus retained thrace and seleucus i controlled babylon"
the second diadochi war began following the death of antipater in 319 bc
"passing over his own son, cassander, antipater had declared polyperchon his successor as regent"
"cassander rose in revolt against polyperchon  and was supported by antigonus, lysimachus and ptolemy"
"in 317 bc, cassander invaded macedonia, attaining control of macedon, sentencing olympias to death and capturing the boy king alexander iv, and his mother"
"in asia, eumenes was betrayed by his own men after years of campaign and was given up to antigonus who had him executed"
the third war of the diadochi broke out because of the growing power and ambition of antigonus
"he began removing and appointing satraps as if he were king and also raided the royal treasuries in ecbatana, persepolis and susa, making off with 25,000 talents"
"seleucus was forced to flee to egypt and antigonus was soon at war with ptolemy, lysimachus, and cassander"
"he then invaded phoenicia, laid siege to tyre, stormed gaza and began building a fleet"
"ptolemy invaded syria and defeated antigonus' son, demetrius poliorcetes, in the battle of gaza of 312 bc which allowed seleucus to secure control of babylonia, and the eastern satrapies"
"in 310 bc, cassander had young king alexander iv and his mother roxana murdered, ending the argead dynasty which had ruled macedon for several centuries"
antigonus then sent his son demetrius to regain control of greece
"in 307 bc he took athens, expelling demetrius of phaleron, cassander's governor, and proclaiming the city free again"
"demetrius now turned his attention to ptolemy, defeating his fleet at the battle of salamis and taking control of cyprus"
"in the aftermath of this victory, antigonus took the title of king  and bestowed it on his son demetrius poliorcetes, the rest of the diadochi soon followed suit"
"demetrius continued his campaigns by laying siege to rhodes and conquering most of greece in 302 bc, creating a league against cassander's macedon"
"the decisive engagement of the war came when lysimachus invaded and overran much of western anatolia, but was soon isolated by antigonus and demetrius near ipsus in phrygia"
seleucus arrived in time to save lysimachus and utterly crushed antigonus at the battle of ipsus in 301 bc
"seleucus' war elephants proved decisive, antigonus was killed, and demetrius fled back to greece to attempt to preserve the remnants of his rule there by recapturing a rebellious athens"
"meanwhile, lysimachus took over ionia, seleucus took cilicia, and ptolemy captured cyprus. after cassander's death in c"
"298 bc, however, demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded macedon, seized the macedonian throne  and conquered thessaly and most of central greece"
"he was defeated in 288 bc when lysimachus of thrace and pyrrhus of epirus invaded macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves"
demetrius fled to central greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern peloponnese
"he once again laid siege to athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the athenians and ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to asia minor and wage war on lysimachus' holdings in ionia, leaving his son antigonus gonatas in greece"
"after initial successes, he was forced to surrender to seleucus in 285 bc and later died in captivity"
"lysimachus, who had seized macedon and thessaly for himself, was forced into war when seleucus invaded his territories in asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 bc at the battle of corupedium, near sardis"
"seleucus then attempted to conquer lysimachus' european territories in thrace and macedon, but he was assassinated by ptolemy ceraunus , who had taken refuge at the seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of macedon"
ptolemy was killed when macedon was invaded by gauls in 279 bc—his head stuck on a spear—and the country fell into anarchy
"antigonus ii gonatas invaded thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 gauls"
he was quickly hailed as king of macedon and went on to rule for 35 years
"at this point the tripartite territorial division of the hellenistic age was in place, with the main hellenistic powers being macedon under demetrius's son antigonus ii gonatas, the ptolemaic kingdom under the aged ptolemy i and the seleucid empire under seleucus' son antiochus i soter"
epirus was a northwestern greek kingdom in the western balkans ruled by the molossian aeacidae dynasty
epirus was an ally of macedon during the reigns of philip ii and alexander. in 281 pyrrhus  invaded southern italy to aid the city state of tarentum
pyrrhus defeated the romans in the battle of heraclea and at the battle of asculum
"though victorious, he was forced to retreat due to heavy losses, hence the term ""pyrrhic victory"""
pyrrhus then turned south and invaded sicily but was unsuccessful and returned to italy
after the battle of beneventum  pyrrhus lost all his italian holdings and left for epirus
"pyrrhus then went to war with macedonia in 275 bc, deposing antigonus ii gonatas and briefly ruling over macedonia and thessaly until 272"
"afterwards he invaded southern greece, and was killed in battle against argos in 272 bc. after the death of pyrrhus, epirus remained a minor power"
in 233 bc the aeacid royal family was deposed and a federal state was set up called the epirote league
the league was conquered by rome in the third macedonian war
"antigonus ii, a student of zeno of citium, spent most of his rule defending macedon against epirus and cementing macedonian power in greece, first against the athenians in the chremonidean war, and then against the achaean league of aratus of sicyon"
"under the antigonids, macedonia was often short on funds, the pangaeum mines were no longer as productive as under philip ii, the wealth from alexander's campaigns had been used up and the countryside pillaged by the gallic invasion"
a large number of the macedonian population had also been resettled abroad by alexander or had chosen to emigrate to the new eastern greek cities
"up to two-thirds of the population emigrated, and the macedonian army could only count on a levy of 25,000 men, a significantly smaller force than under philip ii"
antigonus ii ruled until his death in 239 bc
"his son demetrius ii soon died in 229 bc, leaving a child  as king, with the general antigonus doson as regent"
"doson led macedon to victory in the war against the spartan king cleomenes iii, and occupied sparta"
"philip v, who came to power when doson died in 221 bc, was the last macedonian ruler with both the talent and the opportunity to unite greece and preserve its independence against the ""cloud rising in the west"": the ever-increasing power of rome"
"he was known as ""the darling of hellas"""
"under his auspices the peace of naupactus  brought the latest war between macedon and the greek leagues  to an end, and at this time he controlled all of greece except athens, rhodes and pergamum"
"in 215 bc philip, with his eye on illyria, formed an alliance with rome's enemy hannibal of carthage, which led to roman alliances with the achaean league, rhodes and pergamum"
"the first macedonian war broke out in 212 bc, and ended inconclusively in 205 bc"
philip continued to wage war against pergamum and rhodes for control of the aegean  and ignored roman demands for non-intervention in greece by invading attica
"in 198 bc, during the second macedonian war philip was decisively defeated at cynoscephalae by the roman proconsul titus quinctius flamininus and macedon lost all its territories in greece proper"
"southern greece was now thoroughly brought into the roman sphere of influence, though it retained nominal autonomy"
"the end of antigonid macedon came when philip v's son, perseus, was defeated and captured by the romans in the third macedonian war"
during the hellenistic period the importance of greece proper within the greek-speaking world declined sharply
"the great centers of hellenistic culture were alexandria and antioch, capitals of ptolemaic egypt and seleucid syria respectively"
"the conquests of alexander greatly widened the horizons of the greek world, making the endless conflicts between the cities which had marked the 5th and 4th centuries bc seem petty and unimportant"
"it led to a steady emigration, particularly of the young and ambitious, to the new greek empires in the east"
"many greeks migrated to alexandria, antioch and the many other new hellenistic cities founded in alexander's wake, as far away as modern afghanistan and pakistan"
"independent city states were unable to compete with hellenistic kingdoms and were usually forced to ally themselves to one of them for defense, giving honors to hellenistic rulers in return for protection"
"one example is athens, which had been decisively defeated by antipater in the lamian war  and had its port in the piraeus garrisoned by macedonian troops who supported a conservative oligarchy"
"after demetrius poliorcetes captured athens in 307 bc and restored the democracy, the athenians honored him and his father antigonus by placing gold statues of them on the agora and granting them the title of king"
"athens later allied itself to ptolemaic egypt to throw off macedonian rule, eventually setting up a religious cult for the ptolemaic kings and naming one of the city's phyles in honour of ptolemy for his aid against macedon"
"in spite of the ptolemaic monies and fleets backing their endeavors, athens and sparta were defeated by antigonus ii during the chremonidean war"
"athens was then occupied by macedonian troops, and run by macedonian officials"
"sparta remained independent, but it was no longer the leading military power in the peloponnese"
the spartan king cleomenes iii  staged a military coup against the conservative ephors and pushed through radical social and land reforms in order to increase the size of the shrinking spartan citizenry able to provide military service and restore spartan power
"sparta's bid for supremacy was crushed at the battle of sellasia  by the achaean league and macedon, who restored the power of the ephors"
"other city states formed federated states in self-defense, such as the aetolian league , the achaean league , the boeotian league, the ""northern league""  and the ""nesiotic league"" of the cyclades"
"these federations involved a central government which controlled foreign policy and military affairs, while leaving most of the local governing to the city states, a system termed sympoliteia"
"in states such as the achaean league, this also involved the admission of other ethnic groups into the federation with equal rights, in this case, non-achaeans"
"the achean league was able to drive out the macedonians from the peloponnese and free corinth, which duly joined the league"
one of the few city states who managed to maintain full independence from the control of any hellenistic kingdom was rhodes
"with a skilled navy to protect its trade fleets from pirates and an ideal strategic position covering the routes from the east into the aegean, rhodes prospered during the hellenistic period"
"it became a center of culture and commerce, its coins were widely circulated and its philosophical schools became one of the best in the mediterranean"
"after holding out for one year under siege by demetrius poliorcetes , the rhodians built the colossus of rhodes to commemorate their victory"
"they retained their independence by the maintenance of a powerful navy, by maintaining a carefully neutral posture and acting to preserve the balance of power between the major hellenistic kingdoms"
initially rhodes had very close ties with the ptolemaic kingdom
"rhodes later became a roman ally against the seleucids, receiving some territory in caria for their role in the roman–seleucid war"
rome eventually turned on rhodes and annexed the island as a roman province
"the west balkan coast was inhabited by various illyrian tribes and kingdoms such as the kingdom of the dalmatae and of the ardiaei, who often engaged in piracy under queen teuta"
further inland was the illyrian paeonian kingdom and the tribe of the agrianes
"illyrians on the coast of the adriatic were under the effects and influence of hellenisation and some tribes adopted greek, becoming bilingual due to their proximity to the greek colonies in illyria"
illyrians imported weapons and armor from the ancient greeks  and also adopted the ornamentation of ancient macedon on their shields and their war belts
the odrysian kingdom was a union of thracian tribes under the kings of the powerful odrysian tribe
"various parts of thrace were under macedonian rule under philip ii of macedon, alexander the great, lysimachus, ptolemy ii, and philip v but were also often ruled by their own kings"
"the thracians and agrianes were widely used by alexander as peltasts and light cavalry, forming about one fifth of his army"
the diadochi also used thracian mercenaries in their armies and they were also used as colonists
the odrysians used greek as the language of administration and of the nobility
"the nobility also adopted greek fashions in dress, ornament and military equipment, spreading it to the other tribes"
thracian kings were among the first to be hellenized
"after 278 bc the odrysians had a strong competitor in the celtic kingdom of tylis ruled by the kings comontorius and cavarus, but in 212 bc they conquered their enemies and destroyed their capital"
southern italy  and south-eastern sicily had been colonized by the greeks during the 8th century bc
in 4th-century bc sicily the leading greek city and hegemon was syracuse
during the hellenistic period the leading figure in sicily was agathocles of syracuse  who seized the city with an army of mercenaries in 317 bc
"agathocles extended his power throughout most of the greek cities in sicily, fought a long war with the carthaginians, at one point invading tunisia in 310 bc and defeating a carthaginian army there"
this was the first time a european force had invaded the region
"after this war he controlled most of south-east sicily and had himself proclaimed king, in imitation of the hellenistic monarchs of the east"
"agathocles then invaded italy  in defense of tarentum against the bruttians and romans, but was unsuccessful"
"greeks in pre-roman gaul were mostly limited to the mediterranean coast of provence, france"
"the first greek colony in the region was massalia, which became one of the largest trading ports of mediterranean by the 4th century bc with 6,000 inhabitants"
"massalia was also the local hegemon, controlling various coastal greek cities like nice and agde"
the coins minted in massalia have been found in all parts of liguro-celtic gaul
"celtic coinage was influenced by greek designs, and greek letters can be found on various celtic coins, especially those of southern france"
"traders from massalia ventured inland deep into france on the rivers durance and rhône, and established overland trade routes deep into gaul, and to switzerland and burgundy"
"the hellenistic period saw the greek alphabet spread into southern gaul from massalia  and according to strabo, massalia was also a center of education, where celts went to learn greek"
"a staunch ally of rome, massalia retained its independence until it sided with pompey in 49 bc and was then taken by caesar's forces"
"the city of emporion , originally founded by archaic-period settlers from phocaea and massalia in the 6th century bc near the village of sant martí d'empúries , was reestablished in the 5th century bc with a new city  on the iberian mainland"
"emporion contained a mixed population of greek colonists and iberian natives, and although livy and strabo assert that they lived in different quarters, these two groups were eventually integrated"
"the city became a dominant trading hub and center of hellenistic civilization in iberia, eventually siding with the roman republic against the carthaginian empire during the second punic war"
"however, emporion lost its political independence around 195 bc with the establishment of the roman province of hispania citerior and by the 1st century bc had become fully romanized in culture"
the hellenistic states of asia and egypt were run by an occupying imperial elite of greco-macedonian administrators and governors propped up by a standing army of mercenaries and a small core of greco-macedonian settlers
promotion of immigration from greece was important in the establishment of this system
hellenistic monarchs ran their kingdoms as royal estates and most of the heavy tax revenues went into the military and paramilitary forces which preserved their rule from any kind of revolution
"macedonian and hellenistic monarchs were expected to lead their armies on the field, along with a group of privileged aristocratic companions or friends  which dined and drank with the king and acted as his advisory council"
the monarch was also expected to serve as a charitable patron of the people; this public philanthropy could mean building projects and handing out gifts but also promotion of greek culture and religion
"ptolemy, a somatophylax, one of the seven bodyguards who served as alexander the great's generals and deputies, was appointed satrap of egypt after alexander's death in 323 bc"
"in 305 bc, he declared himself king ptolemy i, later known as ""soter""  for his role in helping the rhodians during the siege of rhodes"
"ptolemy built new cities such as ptolemais hermiou in upper egypt and settled his veterans throughout the country, especially in the region of the faiyum"
"alexandria, a major center of greek culture and trade, became his capital city"
"as egypt's first port city, it became the main grain exporter in the mediterranean"
"the egyptians begrudgingly accepted the ptolemies as the successors to the pharaohs of independent egypt, though the kingdom went through several native revolts"
"ptolemy i began to order monetary contributions from the people, and as a result rewarded cities with high contribution with royal benefaction"
this often resulted in the formation of a royal cult within the city
reservations about this activity slowly dissipated as this worship of mortals was justified by the precedent of the worshipping of greek heroes
"the ptolemies took on the traditions of the egyptian pharaohs, such as marrying their siblings , having themselves portrayed on public monuments in egyptian style and dress, and participating in egyptian religious life"
"the ptolemaic ruler cult portrayed the ptolemies as gods, and temples to the ptolemies were erected throughout the kingdom"
"ptolemy i even created a new god, serapis, who was a combination of two egyptian gods: apis and osiris, with attributes of greek gods"
"ptolemaic administration was, like the ancient egyptian bureaucracy, highly centralized and focused on squeezing as much revenue out of the population as possible through tariffs, excise duties, fines, taxes, and so forth"
"a whole class of petty officials, tax farmers, clerks, and overseers made this possible"
the egyptian countryside was directly administered by this royal bureaucracy
"external possessions such as cyprus and cyrene were run by strategoi, military commanders appointed by the crown"
"under ptolemy ii, callimachus, apollonius of rhodes, theocritus, and a host of other poets including the alexandrian pleiad made the city a center of hellenistic literature"
"ptolemy himself was eager to patronise the library, scientific research and individual scholars who lived on the grounds of the library"
"he and his successors also fought a series of wars with the seleucids, known as the syrian wars, over the region of coele-syria"
"ptolemy iv won the great battle of raphia  against the seleucids, using native egyptians trained as phalangites"
"however these egyptian soldiers revolted, eventually setting up a native breakaway egyptian state in the thebaid between 205 and 186/185 bc, severely weakening the ptolemaic state"
ptolemy's family ruled egypt until the roman conquest of 30 bc. all the male rulers of the dynasty took the name ptolemy
"ptolemaic queens, some of whom were the sisters of their husbands, were usually called cleopatra, arsinoe, or berenice"
"the most famous member of the line was the last queen, cleopatra vii, known for her role in the roman political battles between julius caesar and pompey, and later between octavian and mark antony"
"her suicide at the conquest by rome marked the end of ptolemaic rule in egypt, though hellenistic culture continued to thrive in egypt throughout the roman and byzantine periods until the muslim conquest"
"following division of alexander's empire, seleucus i nicator received babylonia"
"from there, he created a new empire which expanded to include much of alexander's near eastern territories"
"at the height of its power, it included central anatolia, the levant, mesopotamia, persia, today's turkmenistan, pamir, and parts of pakistan"
it included a diverse population estimated at fifty to sixty million people
"under antiochus i , however, the unwieldy empire was already beginning to shed territories"
pergamum broke away under eumenes i who defeated a seleucid army sent against him
"the kingdoms of cappadocia, bithynia and pontus were all practically independent by this time as well"
"like the ptolemies, antiochus i established a dynastic religious cult, deifying his father seleucus i"
"seleucus, officially said to be descended from apollo, had his own priests and monthly sacrifices"
"the erosion of the empire continued under seleucus ii, who was forced to fight a civil war  against his brother antiochus hierax and was unable to keep bactria, sogdiana and parthia from breaking away"
"hierax carved off most of seleucid anatolia for himself, but was defeated, along with his galatian allies, by attalus i of pergamon who now also claimed kingship"
"the vast seleucid empire was, like egypt, mostly dominated by a greco-macedonian political elite"
the greek population of the cities who formed the dominant elite were reinforced by emigration from greece
"these cities included newly founded colonies such as antioch, the other cities of the syrian tetrapolis, seleucia  and dura-europos on the euphrates"
"these cities retained traditional greek city state institutions such as assemblies, councils and elected magistrates, but this was a facade for they were always controlled by the royal seleucid officials"
"apart from these cities, there were also a large number of seleucid garrisons , military colonies  and greek villages  which the seleucids planted throughout the empire to cement their rule"
"this 'greco-macedonian' population  could make up a phalanx of 35,000 men  during the reign of antiochus iii"
the rest of the army was made up of native troops
antiochus iii  conducted several vigorous campaigns to retake all the lost provinces of the empire since the death of seleucus i
"after being defeated by ptolemy iv's forces at raphia , antiochus iii led a long campaign to the east to subdue the far eastern breakaway provinces  including bactria, parthia, ariana, sogdiana, gedrosia and drangiana"
"he was successful, bringing back most of these provinces into at least nominal vassalage and receiving tribute from their rulers"
"after the death of ptolemy iv , antiochus took advantage of the weakness of egypt to conquer coele-syria in the fifth syrian war"
"he then began expanding his influence into pergamene territory in asia and crossed into europe, fortifying lysimachia on the hellespont, but his expansion into anatolia and greece was abruptly halted after a decisive defeat at the battle of magnesia"
"in the treaty of apamea which ended the war, antiochus lost all of his territories in anatolia west of the taurus and was forced to pay a large indemnity of 15,000 talents"
"much of the eastern part of the empire was then conquered by the parthians under mithridates i of parthia in the mid-2nd century bc, yet the seleucid kings continued to rule a rump state from syria until the invasion by the armenian king tigranes the great and their ultimate overthrow by the roman general pompey"
"after the death of lysimachus, one of his officers, philetaerus, took control of the city of pergamum in 282 bc along with lysimachus' war chest of 9,000 talents and declared himself loyal to seleucus i while remaining de facto independent"
"his descendant, attalus i, defeated the invading galatians and proclaimed himself an independent king"
"attalus i , was a staunch ally of rome against philip v of macedon during the first and second macedonian wars"
"for his support against the seleucids in 190 bc, eumenes ii was rewarded with all the former seleucid domains in asia minor"
"eumenes ii turned pergamon into a centre of culture and science by establishing the library of pergamum which was said to be second only to the library of alexandria with 200,000 volumes according to plutarch"
it included a reading room and a collection of paintings
eumenes ii also constructed the pergamum altar with friezes depicting the gigantomachy on the acropolis of the city
pergamum was also a center of parchment  production
the attalids ruled pergamon until attalus iii bequeathed the kingdom of pergamon to the roman republic in 133 bc to avoid a likely succession crisis
the celts who settled in galatia came through thrace under the leadership of leotarios and leonnorios c. 270 bc
"270 bc. they were defeated by seleucus i in the 'battle of the elephants', but were still able to establish a celtic territory in central anatolia"
the galatians were well respected as warriors and were widely used as mercenaries in the armies of the successor states
"they continued to attack neighboring kingdoms such as bithynia and pergamon, plundering and extracting tribute"
"this came to an end when they sided with the renegade seleucid prince antiochus hierax who tried to defeat attalus, the ruler of pergamon"
"attalus severely defeated the gauls, forcing them to confine themselves to galatia"
the theme of the dying gaul  remained a favorite in hellenistic art for a generation signifying the victory of the greeks over a noble enemy
"in the early 2nd century bc, the galatians became allies of antiochus the great, the last seleucid king trying to regain suzerainty over asia minor"
"in 189 bc, rome sent gnaeus manlius vulso on an expedition against the galatians"
galatia was henceforth dominated by rome through regional rulers from 189 bc onward
"after their defeats by pergamon and rome the galatians slowly became hellenized and they were called ""gallo-graeci"" by the historian justin as well as ἑλληνογαλάται  by diodorus siculus in his bibliotheca historica v"
"32.5, who wrote that they were ""called helleno-galatians because of their connection with the greeks"
""" the bithynians were a thracian people living in northwest anatolia"
"after alexander's conquests the region of bithynia came under the rule of the native king bas, who defeated calas, a general of alexander the great, and maintained the independence of bithynia"
"his son, zipoetes i of bithynia maintained this autonomy against lysimachus and seleucus i, and assumed the title of king  in 297 bc"
"his son and successor, nicomedes i, founded nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign , as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of anatolia"
"nicomedes also invited the celtic galatians into anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son prusias i, who defeated them in battle"
"their last king, nicomedes iv, was unable to maintain himself against mithridates vi of pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the roman senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the roman republic"
the nabatean kingdom was an arab state located between the sinai peninsula and the arabian peninsula
"its capital was the city of petra, an important trading city on the incense route"
"the nabateans resisted the attacks of antigonus and were allies of the hasmoneans in their struggle against the seleucids, but later fought against herod the great"
the hellenization of the nabateans occurred relatively late in comparison to the surrounding regions
nabatean material culture does not show any greek influence until the reign of aretas iii philhellene in the 1st century bc
aretas captured damascus and built the petra pool complex and gardens in the hellenistic style
"though the nabateans originally worshipped their traditional gods in symbolic form such as stone blocks or pillars, during the hellenistic period they began to identify their gods with greek gods and depict them in figurative forms influenced by greek sculpture"
"nabatean art shows greek influences, and paintings have been found depicting dionysian scenes"
they also slowly adopted greek as a language of commerce along with aramaic and arabic
"cappadocia, a mountainous region situated between pontus and the taurus mountains, was ruled by a persian dynasty"
ariarathes i  was the satrap of cappadocia under the persians and after the conquests of alexander he retained his post
"after alexander's death he was defeated by eumenes and crucified in 322 bc, but his son, ariarathes ii managed to regain the throne and maintain his autonomy against the warring diadochi"
"in 255 bc, ariarathes iii took the title of king and married stratonice, a daughter of antiochus ii, remaining an ally of the seleucid kingdom"
"under ariarathes iv, cappadocia came into relations with rome, first as a foe espousing the cause of antiochus the great, then as an ally against perseus of macedon and finally in a war against the seleucids"
"ariarathes v also waged war with rome against aristonicus, a claimant to the throne of pergamon, and their forces were annihilated in 130 bc"
this defeat allowed pontus to invade and conquer the kingdom
orontid armenia formally passed to the empire of alexander the great following his conquest of persia
alexander appointed an orontid named mithranes to govern armenia
"armenia later became a vassal state of the seleucid empire, but it maintained a considerable degree of autonomy, retaining its native rulers"
"towards the end 212 bc the country was divided into two kingdoms, greater armenia and armenia sophene, including commagene or armenia minor"
the kingdoms became so independent from seleucid control that antiochus iii the great waged war on them during his reign and replaced their rulers
"after the seleucid defeat at the battle of magnesia in 190 bc, the kings of sophene and greater armenia revolted and declared their independence, with artaxias becoming the first king of the artaxiad dynasty of armenia in 188 bc"
"during the reign of the artaxiads, armenia went through a period of hellenization"
"numismatic evidence shows greek artistic styles and the use of the greek language. some coins describe the armenian kings as ""philhellenes"""
"during the reign of tigranes the great , the kingdom of armenia reached its greatest extent, containing many greek cities, including the entire syrian tetrapolis"
"cleopatra, the wife of tigranes the great, invited greeks such as the rhetor amphicrates and the historian metrodorus of scepsis to the armenian court, and—according to plutarch—when the roman general lucullus seized the armenian capital, tigranocerta, he found a troupe of greek actors who had arrived to perform plays for tigranes"
tigranes' successor artavasdes ii even composed greek tragedies himself
parthia was a north-eastern iranian satrapy of the achaemenid empire which later passed on to alexander's empire
"under the seleucids, parthia was governed by various greek satraps such as nicanor and philip"
"in 247 bc, following the death of antiochus ii theos, andragoras, the seleucid governor of parthia, proclaimed his independence and began minting coins showing himself wearing a royal diadem and claiming kingship"
"he ruled until 238 bc when arsaces, the leader of the parni tribe conquered parthia, killing andragoras and inaugurating the arsacid dynasty"
antiochus iii recaptured arsacid controlled territory in 209 bc from arsaces ii. arsaces ii sued for peace and became a vassal of the seleucids
"it was not until the reign of phraates i , that the arsacids would again begin to assert their independence"
"during the reign of mithridates i of parthia, arsacid control expanded to include herat , babylonia , media , persia , and large parts of syria"
"the seleucid–parthian wars continued as the seleucids invaded mesopotamia under antiochus vii sidetes , but he was eventually killed by a parthian counterattack"
"after the fall of the seleucid dynasty, the parthians fought frequently against neighbouring rome in the roman–parthian wars"
abundant traces of hellenism continued under the parthian empire
the parthians used greek as well as their own parthian language  as languages of administration and also used greek drachmas as coinage
"they enjoyed greek theater, and greek art influenced parthian art"
the parthians continued worshipping greek gods syncretized together with iranian deities
their rulers established ruler cults in the manner of hellenistic kings and often used hellenistic royal epithets
"the hellenistic influence in iran was significant in terms of scope, but not depth and durability—unlike the near east, the iranian–zoroastrian ideas and ideals remained the main source of inspiration in mainland iran, and was soon revived in late parthian and sasanian periods"
"during the hellenistic period, judea became a frontier region between the seleucid empire and ptolemaic egypt and therefore was often the frontline of the syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts"
"under the hellenistic kingdoms, judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the high priest of israel as a hellenistic vassal"
"this period also saw the rise of a hellenistic judaism, which first developed in the jewish diaspora of alexandria and antioch, and then spread to judea"
the major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the septuagint translation of the hebrew bible from biblical hebrew and biblical aramaic to koiné greek
the reason for the production of this translation seems to be that many of the alexandrian jews had lost the ability to speak hebrew and aramaic
"between 301 and 219 bc the ptolemies ruled judea in relative peace, and jews often found themselves working in the ptolemaic administration and army, which led to the rise of a hellenized jewish elite class"
the wars of antiochus iii brought the region into the seleucid empire; jerusalem fell to his control in 198 bc and the temple was repaired and provided with money and tribute
antiochus iv epiphanes sacked jerusalem and looted the temple in 169 bc after disturbances in judea during his abortive invasion of egypt
antiochus then banned key jewish religious rites and traditions in judea
he may have been attempting to hellenize the region and unify his empire and the jewish resistance to this eventually led to an escalation of violence
"whatever the case, tensions between pro- and anti-seleucid jewish factions led to the 174–135 bc maccabean revolt of judas maccabeus"
modern interpretations see this period as a civil war between hellenized and orthodox forms of judaism
"out of this revolt was formed an independent jewish kingdom known as the hasmonaean dynasty, which lasted from 165 bc to 63 bc"
"the hasmonean dynasty eventually disintegrated in a civil war, which coincided with civil wars in rome"
"the last hasmonean ruler, antigonus ii mattathias, was captured by herod and executed in 37 bc"
"in spite of originally being a revolt against greek overlordship, the hasmonean kingdom and also the herodian kingdom which followed gradually became more and more hellenized"
"from 37 bc to 4 bc, herod the great ruled as a jewish-roman client king appointed by the roman senate"
"he considerably enlarged the temple , making it one of the largest religious structures in the world"
the style of the enlarged temple and other herodian architecture shows significant hellenistic architectural influence
"his son, herod archelaus, ruled from 4 bc to ad 6 when he was deposed for the formation of roman judea"
the kingdom of pontus was a hellenistic kingdom on the southern coast of the black sea
it was founded by mithridates i in 291 bc and lasted until its conquest by the roman republic in 63 bc
despite being ruled by a dynasty which was a descendant of the persian achaemenid empire it became hellenized due to the influence of the greek cities on the black sea and its neighboring kingdoms
"pontic culture was a mix of greek and iranian elements; the most hellenized parts of the kingdom were on the coast, populated by greek colonies such as trapezus and sinope, the latter of which became the capital of the kingdom"
epigraphic evidence also shows extensive hellenistic influence in the interior
"during the reign of mithridates ii, pontus was allied with the seleucids through dynastic marriages"
"by the time of mithridates vi eupator, greek was the official language of the kingdom, though anatolian languages continued to be spoken"
"the kingdom grew to its largest extent under mithridates vi, who conquered colchis, cappadocia, paphlagonia, bithynia, lesser armenia, the bosporan kingdom, the greek colonies of the tauric chersonesos and, for a brief time, the roman province of asia"
"mithridates, himself of mixed persian and greek ancestry, presented himself as the protector of the greeks against the 'barbarians' of rome styling himself as ""king mithridates eupator dionysus"" and as the ""great liberator"""
"mithridates also depicted himself with the anastole hairstyle of alexander and used the symbolism of herakles, from whom the macedonian kings claimed descent"
"after a long struggle with rome in the mithridatic wars, pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the roman republic as the province of bithynia, while pontus' eastern half survived as a client kingdom"
"the greek kingdom of bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control"
"between 255 and 246 bc, the governor of bactria, sogdiana and margiana , one diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king"
"diodotus ii, son of diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 bc by euthydemus, possibly the satrap of sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. in c"
"in c. 210 bc, the greco-bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent seleucid empire under antiochus iii"
"while victorious in the field, it seems antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo , and married one of his daughters to euthydemus's son, thus legitimizing the greco-bactrian dynasty"
"soon afterwards the greco-bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the parthian king arsaces ii by antiochus"
"according to strabo, the greco-bactrians seem to have had contacts with china through the silk road trade routes"
"indian sources also maintain religious contact between buddhist monks and the greeks, and some greco-bactrians did convert to buddhism"
"demetrius, son and successor of euthydemus, invaded north-western india in 180 bc, after the destruction of the mauryan empire there; the mauryans were probably allies of the bactrians"
"the exact justification for the invasion remains unclear, but by about 175 bc, the greeks ruled over parts of northwestern india"
this period also marks the beginning of the obfuscation of greco-bactrian history
demetrius possibly died about 180 bc; numismatic evidence suggests the existence of several other kings shortly thereafter
"it is probable that at this point the greco-bactrian kingdom split into several semi-independent regions for some years, often warring amongst themselves"
"heliocles was the last greek to clearly rule bactria, his power collapsing in the face of central asian tribal invasions , by about 130 bc"
"however, greek urban civilisation seems to have continued in bactria after the fall of the kingdom, having a hellenising effect on the tribes which had displaced greek rule"
the kushan empire which followed continued to use greek on their coinage and greeks continued being influential in the empire
"the separation of the indo-greek kingdom from the greco-bactrian kingdom resulted in an even more isolated position, and thus the details of the indo-greek kingdom are even more obscure than for bactria"
many supposed kings in india are known only because of coins bearing their name
the numismatic evidence together with archaeological finds and the scant historical records suggest that the fusion of eastern and western cultures reached its peak in the indo-greek kingdom
"after demetrius' death, civil wars between bactrian kings in india allowed apollodotus i  to make himself independent as the first proper indo-greek king"
"large numbers of his coins have been found in india, and he seems to have reigned in gandhara as well as western punjab"
"apollodotus i was succeeded by or ruled alongside antimachus ii, likely the son of the bactrian king antimachus i"
"in about 155  bc he seems to have been succeeded by the most successful of the indo-greek kings, menander i"
"menander converted to buddhism, and seems to have been a great patron of the religion; he is remembered in some buddhist texts as 'milinda'"
"he also expanded the kingdom further east into punjab, though these conquests were rather ephemeral"
"after the death of menander , the kingdom appears to have fragmented, with several 'kings' attested contemporaneously in different regions"
"this inevitably weakened the greek position, and territory seems to have been lost progressively"
"around 70 bc, the western regions of arachosia and paropamisadae were lost to tribal invasions, presumably by those tribes responsible for the end of the bactrian kingdom"
the resulting indo-scythian kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining indo-greek kingdom towards the east
"the indo-greek kingdom appears to have lingered on in western punjab until about ad 10, at which time it was finally ended by the indo-scythians"
strato iii was the last of the dynasty of diodotus was the last of the line of diodotus and independent hellenistic king to rule at his death in 10 ad
"after conquering the indo-greeks, the kushan empire took over greco-buddhism, the greek language, greek script, greek coinage and artistic styles"
greeks continued being an important part of the cultural world of india for generations
the depictions of the buddha appear to have been influenced by greek culture: buddha representations in the ghandara period often showed buddha under the protection of herakles
several references in indian literature praise the knowledge of the yavanas or the greeks
"the mahabharata compliments them as ""the all-knowing yavanas"" ; e.g., ""the yavanas, o king, are all-knowing; the suras are particularly so"
"the mlecchas are wedded to the creations of their own fancy"", such as flying machines that are generally called vimanas"
"the ""brihat-samhita"" of the mathematician varahamihira says: ""the greeks, though impure, must be honored since they were trained in sciences and therein, excelled others"
".."". widespread roman interference in the greek world was probably inevitable given the general manner of the ascendancy of the roman republic"
this roman-greek interaction began as a consequence of the greek city-states located along the coast of southern italy
"rome had come to dominate the italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the greek cities to its rule"
"although they initially resisted, allying themselves with pyrrhus of epirus, and defeating the romans at several battles, the greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the roman republic"
"shortly afterward, rome became involved in sicily, fighting against the carthaginians in the first punic war"
"the result was the complete conquest of sicily, including its previously powerful greek cities, by the romans"
"after the second punic war, the romans looked to re-assert their influence in the balkans, and to curb the expansion of philip v of macedon"
"a pretext for war was provided by philip's refusal to end his war with attalid pergamum and rhodes, both roman allies"
"the romans, also allied with the aetolian league of greek city-states , thus declared war on macedon in 200 bc, starting the second macedonian war"
this ended with a decisive roman victory at the battle of cynoscephalae
"like most roman peace treaties of the period, the resultant 'peace of flaminius' was designed utterly to crush the power of the defeated party; a massive indemnity was levied, philip's fleet was surrendered to rome, and macedon was effectively returned to its ancient boundaries, losing influence over the city-states of southern greece, and land in thrace and asia minor"
the result was the end of macedon as a major power in the mediterranean
"in less than twenty years, rome had destroyed the power of one of the successor states, crippled another, and firmly entrenched its influence over greece"
"this was primarily a result of the over-ambition of the macedonian kings, and their unintended provocation of rome, though rome was quick to exploit the situation"
"in another twenty years, the macedonian kingdom was no more"
"seeking to re-assert macedonian power and greek independence, philip v's son perseus incurred the wrath of the romans, resulting in the third macedonian war"
"victorious, the romans abolished the macedonian kingdom, replacing it with four puppet republics until it was formally annexed as a roman province after yet another rebellion under andriscus"
"rome now demanded that the achaean league, the last stronghold of greek independence, be dissolved. the achaeans refused and declared war on rome"
"most of the greek cities rallied to the achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for greek independence"
"the roman consul lucius mummius advanced from macedonia and defeated the greeks at corinth, which was razed to the ground"
"in 146 bc, the greek peninsula, though not the islands, became a roman protectorate"
"roman taxes were imposed, except in athens and sparta, and all the cities had to accept rule by rome's local allies"
"the attalid dynasty of pergamum lasted little longer; a roman ally until the end, its final king attalus iii died in 133 bc without an heir, and taking the alliance to its natural conclusion, willed pergamum to the roman republic"
"the final greek resistance came in 88 bc, when king mithridates of pontus rebelled against rome, captured roman held anatolia, and massacred up to 100,000 romans and roman allies across asia minor"
"many greek cities, including athens, overthrew their roman puppet rulers and joined him in the mithridatic wars"
"when he was driven out of greece by the roman general lucius cornelius sulla, the latter laid siege to athens and razed the city"
mithridates was finally defeated by gnaeus pompeius magnus  in 65 bc
"further ruin was brought to greece by the roman civil wars, which were partly fought in greece"
"finally, in 27 bc, augustus directly annexed greece to the new roman empire as the province of achaea"
the struggles with rome had left greece depopulated and demoralised
"nevertheless, roman rule at least brought an end to warfare, and cities such as athens, corinth, thessaloniki and patras soon recovered their prosperity"
"eventually, instability in the near east resulting from the power vacuum left by the collapse of the seleucid empire caused the roman proconsul pompey the great to abolish the seleucid rump state, absorbing much of syria into the roman republic"
"famously, the end of ptolemaic egypt came as the final act in the republican civil war between the roman triumvirs mark anthony and augustus caesar"
"after the defeat of anthony and his lover, the last ptolemaic monarch, cleopatra vii, at the battle of actium, augustus invaded egypt and took it as his own personal fiefdom"
"he thereby completed the destruction of the hellenistic kingdoms and transformed the roman republic into a monarchy, ending  the hellenistic era"
greek culture was at its height of world influence in the hellenistic period
hellenism or at least philhellenism reached most regions on the frontiers of the hellenistic kingdoms
"though some of these regions were not ruled by greeks or even greek speaking elites, hellenistic influence can be seen in the historical record and material culture of these regions"
"other regions had established contact with greek colonies before this period, and simply saw a continued process of hellenization and intermixing"
"the spread of greek culture and language throughout the near east and asia owed much to the development of newly founded cities and deliberate colonization policies by the successor states, which in turn was necessary for maintaining their military forces"
"settlements such as ai-khanoum, on trade routes, allowed greek culture to mix and spread"
"the language of philip ii's and alexander's court and army  was a version of attic greek, and over time this language developed into koine, the lingua franca of the successor states"
the spread of greek influence and language is also shown through ancient greek coinage
"portraits became more realistic, and the obverse of the coin was often used to display a propagandistic image, commemorating an event or displaying the image of a favored god"
"the use of greek-style portraits and greek language continued under the roman, parthian, and kushan empires, even as the use of greek was in decline"
"in some fields hellenistic culture thrived, particularly in its preservation of the past"
the states of the hellenistic period were deeply fixated with the past and its seemingly lost glories
the preservation of many classical and archaic works of art and literature  are due to the efforts of the hellenistic greeks
the museum and library of alexandria was the center of this conservationist activity
"with the support of royal stipends, alexandrian scholars collected, translated, copied, classified, and critiqued every book they could find"
most of the great literary figures of the hellenistic period studied at alexandria and conducted research there
"they were scholar poets, writing not only poetry but treatises on homer and other archaic and classical greek literature"
"athens retained its position as the most prestigious seat of higher education, especially in the domains of philosophy and rhetoric, with considerable libraries and philosophical schools"
"alexandria had the monumental museum  and library of alexandria which was estimated to have had 700,000 volumes"
the city of pergamon also had a large library and became a major center of book production
the island of rhodes had a library and also boasted a famous finishing school for politics and diplomacy
"libraries were also present in antioch, pella, and kos. cicero was educated in athens and mark antony in rhodes"
antioch was founded as a metropolis and center of greek learning which retained its status into the era of christianity
seleucia replaced babylon as the metropolis of the lower tigris
"the identification of local gods with similar greek deities, a practice termed 'interpretatio graeca', stimulated the building of greek-style temples, and greek culture in the cities meant that buildings such as gymnasia and theaters became common"
"many cities maintained nominal autonomy while under the rule of the local king or satrap, and often had greek-style institutions"
"greek dedications, statues, architecture, and inscriptions have all been found"
"however, local cultures were not replaced, and mostly went on as before, but now with a new greco-macedonian or otherwise hellenized elite"
"an example that shows the spread of greek theater is plutarch's story of the death of crassus, in which his head was taken to the parthian court and used as a prop in a performance of the bacchae"
"theaters have also been found: for example, in ai-khanoum on the edge of bactria, the theater has 35 rows – larger than the theater in babylon"
"the concept of hellenization, meaning the adoption of greek culture in non-greek regions, has long been controversial"
"undoubtedly greek influence did spread through the hellenistic realms, but to what extent, and whether this was a deliberate policy or mere cultural diffusion, have been hotly debated"
"it seems likely that alexander himself pursued policies which led to hellenization, such as the foundations of new cities and greek colonies"
"while it may have been a deliberate attempt to spread greek culture , it is more likely that it was a series of pragmatic measures designed to aid in the rule of his enormous empire"
cities and colonies were centers of administrative control and macedonian power in a newly conquered region
alexander also seems to have attempted to create a mixed greco-persian elite class as shown by the susa weddings and his adoption of some forms of persian dress and court culture
he also brought persian and other non-greek peoples into his military and even the elite cavalry units of the companion cavalry
"again, it is probably better to see these policies as a pragmatic response to the demands of ruling a large empire than to any idealized attempt to bringing greek culture to the 'barbarians'"
this approach was bitterly resented by the macedonians and discarded by most of the diadochi after alexander's death
these policies can also be interpreted as the result of alexander's possible megalomania during his later years
"after alexander's death in 323 bc, the influx of greek colonists into the new realms continued to spread greek culture into asia"
"the founding of new cities and military colonies continued to be a major part of the successors' struggle for control of any particular region, and these continued to be centers of cultural diffusion"
"the spread of greek culture under the successors seems mostly to have occurred with the spreading of greeks themselves, rather than as an active policy"
"throughout the hellenistic world, these greco-macedonian colonists considered themselves by and large superior to the native ""barbarians"" and excluded most non-greeks from the upper echelons of courtly and government life"
"most of the native population was not hellenized, had little access to greek culture and often found themselves discriminated against by their hellenic overlords"
"gymnasiums and their greek education, for example, were for greeks only"
"greek cities and colonies may have exported greek art and architecture as far as the indus, but these were mostly enclaves of greek culture for the transplanted greek elite"
the degree of influence that greek culture had throughout the hellenistic kingdoms was therefore highly localized and based mostly on a few great cities like alexandria and antioch
"some natives did learn greek and adopt greek ways, but this was mostly limited to a few local elites who were allowed to retain their posts by the diadochi and also to a small number of mid-level administrators who acted as intermediaries between the greek speaking upper class and their subjects"
"in the seleucid empire, for example, this group amounted to only 2.5 percent of the official class"
hellenistic art nevertheless had a considerable influence on the cultures that had been affected by the hellenistic expansion
"as far as the indian subcontinent, hellenistic influence on indian art was broad and far-reaching, and had effects for several centuries following the forays of alexander the great"
"despite their initial reluctance, the successors seem to have later deliberately naturalized themselves to their different regions, presumably in order to help maintain control of the population"
"in the ptolemaic kingdom, we find some egyptianized greeks by the 2nd century onwards"
in the indo-greek kingdom we find kings who were converts to buddhism
"the greeks in the regions therefore gradually become 'localized', adopting local customs as appropriate"
"in this way, hybrid 'hellenistic' cultures naturally emerged, at least among the upper echelons of society"
"the trends of hellenization were therefore accompanied by greeks adopting native ways over time, but this was widely varied by place and by social class"
"the farther away from the mediterranean and the lower in social status, the more likely that a colonist was to adopt local ways, while the greco-macedonian elites and royal families usually remained thoroughly greek and viewed most non-greeks with disdain"
it was not until cleopatra vii that a ptolemaic ruler bothered to learn the egyptian language of their subjects
"in the hellenistic period, there was much continuity in greek religion: the greek gods continued to be worshiped, and the same rites were practiced as before"
however the socio-political changes brought on by the conquest of the persian empire and greek emigration abroad meant that change also came to religious practices
this varied greatly by location
"athens, sparta and most cities in the greek mainland did not see much religious change or new gods , while the multi-ethnic alexandria had a very varied group of gods and religious practices, including egyptian, jewish and greek"
"greek emigres brought their greek religion everywhere they went, even as far as india and afghanistan"
"non-greeks also had more freedom to travel and trade throughout the mediterranean and in this period we can see egyptian gods such as serapis, and the syrian gods atargatis and hadad, as well as a jewish synagogue, all coexisting on the island of delos alongside classical greek deities"
"a common practice was to identify greek gods with native gods that had similar characteristics and this created new fusions like zeus-ammon, aphrodite hagne  and isis-demeter"
"greek emigres faced individual religious choices they had not faced on their home cities, where the gods they worshiped were dictated by tradition"
hellenistic monarchies were closely associated with the religious life of the kingdoms they ruled
"this had already been a feature of macedonian kingship, which had priestly duties"
hellenistic kings adopted patron deities as protectors of their house and sometimes claimed descent from them
"the seleucids for example took on apollo as patron, the antigonids had herakles, and the ptolemies claimed dionysus among others"
"the worship of dynastic ruler cults was also a feature of this period, most notably in egypt, where the ptolemies adopted earlier pharaonic practice, and established themselves as god-kings"
these cults were usually associated with a specific temple in honor of the ruler such as the ptolemaieia at alexandria and had their own festivals and theatrical performances
the setting up of ruler cults was more based on the systematized honors offered to the kings  which put them on par with the gods  than on actual belief of their divine nature
"according to peter green, these cults did not produce genuine belief of the divinity of rulers among the greeks and macedonians"
"the worship of alexander was also popular, as in the long lived cult at erythrae and of course, at alexandria, where his tomb was located"
the hellenistic age also saw a rise in the disillusionment with traditional religion
the rise of philosophy and the sciences had removed the gods from many of their traditional domains such as their role in the movement of the heavenly bodies and natural disasters
"the sophists proclaimed the centrality of humanity and agnosticism; the belief in euhemerism , became popular"
the popular philosopher epicurus promoted a view of disinterested gods living far away from the human realm in metakosmia
the apotheosis of rulers also brought the idea of divinity down to earth
"while there does seem to have been a substantial decline in religiosity, this was mostly reserved for the educated classes"
"magic was practiced widely, and this, too, was a continuation from earlier times"
"throughout the hellenistic world, people would consult oracles, and use charms and figurines to deter misfortune or to cast spells"
"also developed in this era was the complex system of astrology, which sought to determine a person's character and future in the movements of the sun, moon, and planets"
"astrology was widely associated with the cult of tyche , which grew in popularity during this period"
"the hellenistic period saw the rise of new comedy, the only few surviving representative texts being those of menander"
"only one play, dyskolos, survives in its entirety"
"the plots of this new hellenistic comedy of manners were more domestic and formulaic, stereotypical low born characters such as slaves became more important, the language was colloquial and major motifs included escapism, marriage, romance and luck"
"though no hellenistic tragedy remains intact, they were still widely produced during the period, yet it seems that there was no major breakthrough in style, remaining within the classical model"
"the supplementum hellenisticum, a modern collection of extant fragments, contains the fragments of 150 authors"
"hellenistic poets now sought patronage from kings, and wrote works in their honor"
"the scholars at the libraries in alexandria and pergamon focused on the collection, cataloging, and literary criticism of classical athenian works and ancient greek myths"
"the poet-critic callimachus, a staunch elitist, wrote hymns equating ptolemy ii to zeus and apollo"
"he promoted short poetic forms such as the epigram, epyllion and the iambic and attacked epic as base and common"
"he also wrote a massive catalog of the holdings of the library of alexandria, the famous pinakes"
callimachus was extremely influential in his time and also for the development of augustan poetry
"another poet, apollonius of rhodes, attempted to revive the epic for the hellenistic world with his argonautica"
he had been a student of callimachus and later became chief librarian  of the library of alexandria
apollonius and callimachus spent much of their careers feuding with each other
"pastoral poetry also thrived during the hellenistic era, theocritus was a major poet who popularized the genre"
"this period also saw the rise of the ancient greek novel, such as daphnis and chloe and the ephesian tale"
"around 240 bc livius andronicus, a greek slave from southern italy, translated homer's odyssey into latin"
greek literature would have a dominant effect on the development of the latin literature of the romans
"the poetry of virgil, horace and ovid were all based on hellenistic styles"
"during the hellenistic period, many different schools of thought developed, and these schools of hellenistic philosophy had a significant influence on the greek and roman ruling elite"
"athens, with its multiple philosophical schools, continued to remain the center of philosophical thought"
"however, athens had now lost her political freedom, and hellenistic philosophy is a reflection of this new difficult period"
"in this political climate, hellenistic philosophers went in search of goals such as ataraxia , autarky , and apatheia , which would allow them to wrest well-being or eudaimonia out of the most difficult turns of fortune"
"this occupation with the inner life, with personal inner liberty and with the pursuit of eudaimonia is what all hellenistic philosophical schools have in common"
"the epicureans and the cynics eschewed public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the greek world"
epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal
"the cyrenaics and epicureans embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good"
cynics such as diogenes of sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions  as unnatural and useless
"stoicism, founded by zeno of citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with nature or logos"
the philosophical schools of aristotle  and plato  also remained influential
"against these dogmatic schools of philosophy the pyrrhonist school embraced philosophical skepticism, and, starting with arcesilaus, plato's academy also embraced skepticism in the form of academic skepticism"
"the spread of christianity throughout the roman world, followed by the spread of islam, ushered in the end of hellenistic philosophy and the beginnings of medieval philosophy , which was dominated by the three abrahamic traditions: jewish philosophy, christian philosophy, and early islamic philosophy"
"in spite of this shift, hellenistic philosophy continued to influence these three religious traditions and the renaissance thought which followed them"
"science in the hellenistic age differed from that of the previous era in at least two ways: first, it benefited from the cross-fertilization of greek ideas with those that had developed in older civilizations; secondly, to some extent, it was supported by royal patrons in the kingdoms founded by alexander's successors"
"the cultural competition among the hellenistic kingdoms produced seats of learning throughout the mediterranean, of which the most important was alexandria in egypt, which became a major center of scholarship in the 3rd century bc"
"in their scientific investigations, hellenistic scholars frequently employed the principles developed earlier in ancient greece: the application of mathematics to natural phenomena and the undertaking of deliberate empirical research"
"in mathematics, hellenistic geometers built upon the work of mathematicians from the previous generation such as theodorus, archytas, theaetetus, and eudoxus"
"euclid, whose elements became the most important textbook in western mathematics until the 19th century, presented proofs for the pythagorean theorem, for the infinitude of primes, and for the five platonic solids"
archimedes made use of a technique dependent on proof by contradiction to solve problems with an arbitrary degree of accuracy
"known as the method of exhaustion, archimedes used it in several of his works, including to approximate the value of π  and to prove that the area enclosed by a parabola and a straight line is 4/3 times the area of a triangle with equal base and height"
"the most characteristic product of hellenistic mathematics was the theory of conic sections, reaching its greatest achievement in the work of apollonius"
"it made no explicit use of either algebra or trigonometry, the latter appearing around the time of hipparchus"
"in the exact sciences, eratosthenes measured the earth's circumference and calculated the tilt of the earth's axis with remarkable accuracy"
he might have also determined the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day
"eratosthenes drew a map of the world incorporating parallels and meridians, based on the available geographical knowledge of the era"
"another important figure is the astronomer hipparchus, who used babylonian astronomical data and discovered the phenomena of earth's precession"
"pliny reports that hipparchus produced the first systematic star catalog after he observed a new star, wishing to preserve astronomical record of the stars so that new ones could be discovered"
a celestial globe based on hipparchus' star catalog presumably sits atop the broad shoulders of a large 2nd-century roman statue known as the farnese atlas
"another astronomer, aristarchos of samos, measured the distances of the earth, sun, and moon, and developed a heliocentric theory"
"in mechanics, ctesibius wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps, and allegedly designed a kind of cannon as reported by hero of alexandria"
"in the life sciences, medicine made significant advances within the framework of the hippocratic tradition"
"praxagoras theorized that blood traveled through the veins, while herophilos and erasistratus performed dissections and vivisections of humans and animals, providing accurate descriptions of the nervous system, liver and other key organs"
"influenced by philinus of cos, a student of herophilos, the empiric school of medicine focused on strict observation and rejected the unseen causes of the dogmatic school"
"in botany, theophrastus was known for his work in plant classification while crateuas wrote a compendium on botanic pharmacy"
"the library of alexandria presumably included a zoo for research and hellenistic zoologists include archelaos, leonidas of byzantion, apollodoros of alexandria and bion of soloi"
"the technological achievement of the hellenistic age is masterly displayed in the antikythera mechanism, a 37-gear mechanical analog computer which calculated the motions of the sun, moon, and planets, including lunar and solar eclipses"
"devices of this sort are not found again until the 10th century, when a simpler eight-geared luni-solar calculator incorporated into an astrolabe was described by the persian scholar, al-biruni"
similarly complex devices were also developed by other muslim engineers and astronomers during the middle ages
"other technological developments of the hellenistic age include cogged gears, pulleys, archimedes' screw, the screw press, glassblowing, hollow bronze casting, surveying instruments, the odometer, the pantograph, the water clock, the watermill, the water organ, and the piston pump"
"past interpretations of hellenistic science often downplayed its significance, as found for instance in the english classical scholar francis cornford, who believed that ""all the most important and original work was done in the three centuries from 600 to 300 bc"""
"recent interpretations tend to be more generous, leading a few people like mathematician lucio russo to claim that the scientific method was actually born in the 3rd century bc, to be largely forgotten during the roman period and only revived in full during the renaissance"
"hellenistic warfare was a continuation of the military developments of iphicrates and philip ii of macedon, particularly his use of the macedonian phalanx, a dense formation of pikemen, in conjunction with heavy companion cavalry"
armies of the hellenistic period differed from those of the classical period in being largely made up of professional soldiers and also in their greater specialization and technical proficiency in siege warfare
"hellenistic armies were significantly larger than those of classical greece relying increasingly on greek mercenaries  and also on non-greek soldiery such as thracians, galatians, egyptians and iranians"
"some ethnic groups were known for their martial skill in a particular mode of combat and were highly sought after, including tarantine cavalry, cretan archers, rhodian slingers and thracian peltasts"
this period also saw the adoption of new weapons and troop types such as thureophoroi and the thorakitai who used the oval thureos shield and fought with javelins and the machaira sword
"the use of heavily armored cataphracts and also horse archers was adopted by the seleucids, greco-bactrians, armenians and pontus"
the use of war elephants also became common
"seleucus received indian war elephants from the mauryan empire, and used them to good effect at the battle of ipsus"
he kept a core of 500 of them at apameia. the ptolemies used the smaller african elephant
the ptolemies used the smaller african elephant. hellenistic military equipment was generally characterized by an increase in size
hellenistic-era warships grew from the trireme to include more banks of oars and larger numbers of rowers and soldiers as in the quadrireme and quinquereme
the ptolemaic tessarakonteres was the largest ship constructed in antiquity. new siege engines were developed during this period
"an unknown engineer developed the torsion-spring catapult  and dionysios of alexandria designed a repeating ballista, the polybolos"
preserved examples of ball projectiles range from 4.4 to 78 kg
"demetrius poliorcetes was notorious for the large siege engines employed in his campaigns, especially during the 12-month siege of rhodes when he had epimachos of athens build a massive 160 ton siege tower named helepolis, filled with artillery"
"the term hellenistic is a modern invention; the hellenistic world not only included a huge area covering the whole of the aegean, rather than the classical greece focused on the poleis of athens and sparta, but also a huge time range"
"in artistic terms this means that there is huge variety which is often put under the heading of ""hellenistic art"" for convenience"
"hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion  and character"
"the motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art  is reflected in stories such as that of the painter zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them"
the female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the aphrodite of cnidos of praxiteles and art in general became more erotic
the dominant ideals of hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion
people of all ages and social statuses were depicted in the art of the hellenistic age
artists such as peiraikos chose mundane and lower class subjects for his paintings
"according to pliny, ""he painted barbers' shops, cobblers' stalls, asses, eatables and similar subjects, earning for himself the name of rhyparographos"
"in these subjects he could give consummate pleasure, selling them for more than other artists received for their large pictures"""
"even barbarians, such as the galatians, were depicted in heroic form, prefiguring the artistic theme of the noble savage"
"the image of alexander the great was also an important artistic theme, and all of the diadochi had themselves depicted imitating alexander's youthful look"
"a number of the best-known works of greek sculpture belong to the hellenistic period, including laocoön and his sons, venus de milo, and the winged victory of samothrace"
developments in painting included experiments in chiaroscuro by zeuxis and the development of landscape painting and still life painting
"greek temples built during the hellenistic period were generally larger than classical ones, such as the temple of artemis at ephesus, the temple of artemis at sardis, and the temple of apollo at didyma"
"the royal palace  also came into its own during the hellenistic period, the first extant example being the massive 4th-century villa of cassander at vergina"
"this period also saw the first written works of art history in the histories of duris of samos and xenocrates of athens, a sculptor and a historian of sculpture and painting"
"there has been a trend in writing the history of this period to depict hellenistic art as a decadent style, following the golden age of classical athens"
"pliny the elder, after having described the sculpture of the classical period, says: cessavit deinde ars"
the 18th century terms baroque and rococo have sometimes been applied to the art of this complex and individual period
"the renewal of the historiographical approach as well as some recent discoveries, such as the tombs of vergina, allow a better appreciation of this period's artistic richness"
"throughout the hellenistic period, several sports were practiced and promoted across the different cities and kingdoms of the time"
hunting was both a favorite pastime of the macedonian kings and nobles of that age and a favorite subject for paintings
"in egypt, the ptolemaic kings sponsored new athletic festivals, and subsidize 'egyptian' or 'alexandrian' athletes at major competitions"
"egyptian kings also provided funds for athletic facilities to be built, which housed ephebic education and encouraged citizens to partake in gymnasium classes"
ptolemaic and other hellenistic royals often competed at athletic competitions like the olympics or other panathenaic games
females during the hellenistic period were often given opportunities to show off they athletic abilities in similar ways to men
"in egypt, ptolemaic females were well known in terms of court, and during equestrian competitions"
"despite females being banned from watching sports and events like the male olympics, in hellenistic empires, female sport  flourished"
"slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous, metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade, regional metamorphism"
it is the finest-grained foliated metamorphic rock
"foliation may not correspond to the original sedimentary layering, but instead is in planes perpendicular to the direction of metamorphic compression"
"slate is a fine-grained, foliated, homogeneous, metamorphic rock derived from an original shale-type sedimentary rock composed of clay or volcanic ash through low-grade, regional metamorphism"
it is the finest-grained foliated metamorphic rock
"occasionally, as in the purple slates of north wales, ferrous ) reduction spheres form around iron nuclei, leaving a light-green, spotted texture"
"these spheres are sometimes deformed by a subsequent applied stress field into ovoids, which appear as ellipses when viewed on a cleavage plane of the specimen"
"however, some evidence shows that reduced spots may also form after deformation and acquire an elliptical shape from preferential infiltration along the cleavage direction, so caution is required in using reduction ellipsoids to estimate deformation"
"classical greece was a period of around 200 years  in ancient greece, marked by much of the eastern aegean and northern regions of greek culture  gaining increased autonomy from the persian empire; the peak flourishing of democratic athens; the first and second peloponnesian wars; the spartan and then theban hegemonies; and the expansion of macedonia under philip ii"
"much of the early defining politics, artistic thought , scientific thought, theatre, literature and philosophy of western civilization derives from this period of greek history, which had a powerful influence on the later roman empire"
"part of the broader era of classical antiquity, the classical greek era ended after philip ii's unification of most of the greek world against the common enemy of the persian empire, which was conquered within 13 years during the wars of alexander the great, philip's son"
"in the context of the art, architecture, and culture of ancient greece, the classical period corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries bc"
the classical period in this sense follows the greek dark ages and archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the hellenistic period
"this century is essentially studied from the athenian outlook because athens has left us more narratives, plays, and other written works than any of the other ancient greek states"
"from the perspective of athenian culture in classical greece, the period generally referred to as the 5th century bc extends slightly into the 6th century bc"
"in this context, one might consider that the first significant event of this century occurs in 508 bc, with the fall of the last athenian tyrant and cleisthenes' reforms"
"however, a broader view of the whole greek world might place its beginning at the ionian revolt of 500 bc, the event that provoked the persian invasion of 492 bc"
the persians were defeated in 490 bc
"a second persian attempt, in 481–479 bc, failed as well, despite having overrun much of modern-day greece  at a crucial point during the war following the battle of thermopylae and the battle of artemisium"
"the delian league then formed, under athenian hegemony and as athens' instrument"
"athens' successes caused several revolts among the allied cities, all of which were put down by force, but athenian dynamism finally awoke sparta and brought about the peloponnesian war in 431 bc"
"after both forces were spent, a brief peace came about; then the war resumed to sparta's advantage"
"athens was definitively defeated in 404 bc, and internal athenian agitations mark the end of the 5th century bc in greece"
"since its beginning, sparta had been ruled by a diarchy. this meant that sparta had two kings ruling concurrently throughout its entire history"
"the two kingships were both hereditary, vested in the agiad dynasty and the eurypontid dynasty"
"according to legend, the respective hereditary lines of these two dynasties sprang from eurysthenes and procles, twin descendants of hercules"
they were said to have conquered sparta two generations after the trojan war
"in 510 bc, spartan troops helped the athenians overthrow their king, the tyrant hippias, son of peisistratos"
"cleomenes i, king of sparta, put in place a pro-spartan oligarchy headed by isagoras"
"but his rival cleisthenes, with the support of the middle class and aided by pro-democracy citizens, took over"
"cleomenes intervened in 508 and 506 bc, but could not stop cleisthenes, now supported by the athenians"
"through cleisthenes' reforms, the people endowed their city with isonomic institutions—equal rights for all citizens —and established ostracism"
"the isonomic and isegoric  democracy was first organized into about 130 demes, which became the basic civic element"
"the 10,000 citizens exercised their power as members of the assembly , headed by a council of 500 citizens chosen at random"
"the city's administrative geography was reworked, in order to create mixed political groups: not federated by local interests linked to the sea, to the city, or to farming, whose decisions  would depend on their geographical position"
"the territory of the city was also divided into thirty trittyes as follows: ten trittyes in the coastal region  ten trittyes in the ἄστυ , the urban centre ten trittyes in the rural interior,"
"a tribe consisted of three trittyes, selected at random, one from each of the three groups"
each tribe therefore always acted in the interest of all three sectors
it was this corpus of reforms that allowed the emergence of a wider democracy in the 460s and 450s bc
"in ionia , the greek cities, which included great centres such as miletus and halicarnassus, were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the persian empire in the mid-6th century bc"
"in 499 bc that region's greeks rose in the ionian revolt, and athens and some other greek cities sent aid, but were quickly forced to back down after defeat in 494 bc at the battle of lade"
"asia minor returned to persian control. in 492 bc, the persian general mardonius led a campaign through thrace and macedonia"
"he was victorious and again subjugated the former and conquered the latter, but he was wounded and forced to retreat back into asia minor"
"in addition, a fleet of around 1,200 ships that accompanied mardonius on the expedition was wrecked by a storm off the coast of mount athos"
"later, the generals artaphernes and datis led a successful naval expedition against the aegean islands"
"in 490 bc, darius the great, having suppressed the ionian cities, sent a persian fleet to punish the greeks"
"they landed in attica intending to take athens, but were defeated at the battle of marathon by a greek army of 9,000 athenian hoplites and 1,000 plataeans led by the athenian general miltiades"
"the persian fleet continued to athens but, seeing it garrisoned, decided not to attempt an assault"
"in 480 bc, darius' successor xerxes i sent a much more powerful force of 300,000 by land, with 1,207 ships in support, across a double pontoon bridge over the hellespont"
"this army took thrace, before descending on thessaly and boeotia, whilst the persian navy skirted the coast and resupplied the ground troops"
"the greek fleet, meanwhile, dashed to block cape artemision"
"after being delayed by leonidas i, the spartan king of the agiad dynasty, at the battle of thermopylae , xerxes advanced into attica, and captured and burned athens"
"the subsequent battle of artemisium resulted in the capture of euboea, bringing most of mainland greece north of the isthmus of corinth under persian control"
"however, the athenians had evacuated the city of athens by sea before thermopylae, and under the command of themistocles, they defeated the persian fleet at the battle of salamis"
"in 483 bc, during the period of peace between the two persian invasions, a vein of silver ore had been discovered in the laurion , and the hundreds of talents mined there were used to build 200 warships to combat aeginetan piracy"
"a year later, the greeks, under the spartan pausanias, defeated the persian army at plataea"
"the persians then began to withdraw from greece, and never attempted an invasion again"
"the athenian fleet then turned to chasing the persians from the aegean sea, defeating their fleet decisively in the battle of mycale; then in 478 bc the fleet captured byzantium"
"at that time athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland ones into an alliance called the delian league, so named because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of delos"
"the spartans, although they had taken part in the war, withdrew into isolation afterwards, allowing athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power"
in 431 bc war broke out between athens and sparta
"the war was a struggle not merely between two city-states but rather between two coalitions, or leagues of city-states: the delian league, led by athens, and the peloponnesian league, led by sparta"
delian league the delian league grew out of the need to present a unified front of all greek city-states against persian aggression
"in 481 bc, greek city-states, including sparta, met in the first of a series of ""congresses"" that strove to unify all the greek city-states against the danger of another persian invasion"
"the coalition that emerged from the first congress was named the ""hellenic league"" and included sparta"
"persia, under xerxes, invaded greece in september 481 bc, but the athenian navy defeated the persian navy"
"the persian land forces were delayed in 480 bc by a much smaller force of 300 spartans, 400 thebans and 700 men from boeotian thespiae at the battle of thermopylae"
the persians left greece in 479 bc after their defeat at plataea.plataea was the final battle of xerxes' invasion of greece
"after this, the persians never again tried to invade greece"
"with the disappearance of this external threat, cracks appeared in the united front of the hellenic league"
"in 477, athens became the recognised leader of a coalition of city-states that did not include sparta"
"this coalition met and formalized their relationship at the holy city of delos. thus, the league took the name ""delian league"""
"thus, the league took the name ""delian league"". its formal purpose was to liberate greek cities still under persian control"
"however, it became increasingly apparent that the delian league was really a front for athenian hegemony throughout the aegean"
"peloponnesian  league a competing coalition of greek city-states centred around sparta arose, and became more important as the external persian threat subsided"
this coalition is known as the peloponnesian league
"however, unlike the hellenic league and the delian league, this league was not a response to any external threat, persian or otherwise: it was unabashedly an instrument of spartan policy aimed at sparta's security and spartan dominance over the peloponnese peninsula"
"the term ""peloponnesian league"" is a misnomer. it was not really a ""league"" at all. nor was it really ""peloponnesian"""
"nor was it really ""peloponnesian"". there was no equality at all between the members, as might be implied by the term ""league"""
"furthermore, most of its members were located outside the peloponnese peninsula"
"the terms ""spartan league"" and ""peloponnesian league"" are modern terms"
"contemporaries instead referred to ""lacedaemonians and their allies"" to describe the ""league"""
"the league had its origins in sparta's conflict with argos, another city on the peloponnese peninsula"
in the 7th century bc argos dominated the peninsula
even in the early 6th century the argives attempted to control the northeastern part of the peninsula
the rise of sparta in the 6th century brought sparta into conflict with argos
"however, with the conquest of the peloponnesian city-state of tegea in 550 bc and the defeat of the argives in 546 bc the spartans' control began to reach well beyond the borders of laconia"
"as the two coalitions grew, their separate interests kept coming into conflict"
"under the influence of king archidamus ii , sparta, in the late summer or early autumn of 446 bc, concluded the thirty years peace with athens"
"this treaty took effect the next winter in 445 bc under the terms of this treaty, greece was formally divided into two large power zones"
sparta and athens agreed to stay within their own power zone and not to interfere in the other's
"despite the thirty years peace, it was clear that war was inevitable"
"as noted above, at all times during its history down to 221 bc, sparta was a ""diarchy"" with two kings ruling the city-state concurrently"
one line of hereditary kings was from the eurypontid dynasty while the other king was from the agiad dynasty
"with the signing of the thirty years peace treaty, archidamus ii felt he had successfully prevented sparta from entering into a war with its neighbours"
"however, the strong war party in sparta soon won out and in 431 bc archidamus was forced to go to war with the delian league"
"however, in 427 bc, archidamus ii died and his son, agis ii succeeded to the eurypontid throne of sparta"
the immediate causes of the peloponnesian war vary from account to account
"however three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians, namely thucydides and plutarch"
"prior to the war, corinth and one of its colonies, corcyra , went to war in 435 bc over the new corcyran colony of epidamnus"
sparta refused to become involved in the conflict and urged an arbitrated settlement of the struggle
"in 433 bc, corcyra sought athenian assistance in the war. corinth was known to be a traditional enemy of athens"
"however, to further encourage athens to enter the conflict, corcyra pointed out how useful a friendly relationship with corcyra would be, given the strategic locations of corcyra itself and the colony of epidamnus on the east shore of the adriatic sea"
"furthermore, corcyra promised that athens would have the use of corcyra's navy, the third-largest in greece"
"this was too good of an offer for athens to refuse. accordingly, athens signed a defensive alliance with corcyra"
"the next year, in 432 bc, corinth and athens argued over control of potidaea , eventually leading to an athenian siege of potidaea"
"in 434–433 bc athens issued the ""megarian decrees"", a series of decrees that placed economic sanctions on the megarian people"
"the peloponnesian league accused athens of violating the thirty years peace through all of the aforementioned actions, and, accordingly, sparta formally declared war on athens"
many historians consider these to be merely the immediate causes of the war
they would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment on the part of sparta and its allies at the dominance of athens over greek affairs
"the war lasted 27 years, partly because athens  and sparta  found it difficult to come to grips with each other"
"sparta's initial strategy was to invade attica, but the athenians were able to retreat behind their walls"
"an outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused many deaths, including that of pericles"
"at the same time the athenian fleet landed troops in the peloponnesus, winning battles at naupactus  and pylos"
"however, these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory"
"after several years of inconclusive campaigning, the moderate athenian leader nicias concluded the peace of nicias"
"in 418 bc, however, conflict between sparta and the athenian ally argos led to a resumption of hostilities"
alcibiades was one of the most influential voices in persuading the athenians to ally with argos against the spartans
at the mantinea sparta defeated the combined armies of athens and her allies
"accordingly, argos and the rest of the peloponnesus was brought back under the control of sparta"
the return of peace allowed athens to be diverted from meddling in the affairs of the peloponnesus and to concentrate on building up the empire and putting their finances in order
"soon trade recovered and tribute began, once again, rolling into athens"
"a strong ""peace party"" arose, which promoted avoidance of war and continued concentration on the economic growth of the athenian empire"
"concentration on the athenian empire, however, brought athens into conflict with another greek state"
"the melian expedition  ever since the formation of the delian league in 477 bc, the island of melos had refused to join"
"by refusing to join the league, however, melos reaped the benefits of the league without bearing any of the burdens"
"in 425 bc, an athenian army under cleon attacked melos to force the island to join the delian league"
"however, melos fought off the attack and was able to maintain its neutrality"
further conflict was inevitable and in the spring of 416 bc the mood of the people in athens was inclined toward military adventure
the island of melos provided an outlet for this energy and frustration for the military party
"furthermore, there appeared to be no real opposition to this military expedition from the peace party"
enforcement of the economic obligations of the delian league upon rebellious city-states and islands was a means by which continuing trade and prosperity of athens could be assured
melos alone among all the cycladic islands located in the south-west aegean sea had resisted joining the delian league
this continued rebellion provided a bad example to the rest of the members of the delian league
the debate between athens and melos over the issue of joining the delian league is presented by thucydides in his melian dialogue
"the debate did not in the end resolve any of the differences between melos and athens and melos was invaded in 416 bc, and soon occupied by athens"
this success on the part of athens whetted the appetite of the people of athens for further expansion of the athenian empire
"accordingly, the people of athens were ready for military action and tended to support the military party, led by alcibiades"
"the sicilian expedition  thus, in 415 bc, alcibiades found support within the athenian assembly for his position when he urged that athens launch a major expedition against syracuse, a peloponnesian ally in sicily, magna graecia"
"segesta, a town in sicily, had requested athenian assistance in their war with another sicilian town—the town of selinus"
"although nicias was a sceptic about the sicilian expedition, he was appointed along with alcibiades to lead the expedition"
"however, unlike the expedition against melos, the citizens of athens were deeply divided over alcibiades' proposal for an expedition to far-off sicily"
"in june 415 bc, on the very eve of the departure of the athenian fleet for sicily, a band of vandals in athens defaced the many statues of the god hermes that were scattered throughout the city of athens"
this action was blamed on alcibiades and was seen as a bad omen for the coming campaign
"in all likelihood, the coordinated action against the statues of hermes was the action of the peace party"
"having lost the debate on the issue, the peace party was desperate to weaken alcibiades' hold on the people of athens"
successfully blaming alcibiades for the action of the vandals would have weakened alcibiades and the war party in athens
"furthermore, it is unlikely that alcibiades would have deliberately defaced the statues of hermes on the very eve of his departure with the fleet"
such defacement could only have been interpreted as a bad omen for the expedition that he had long advocated
"even before the fleet reached sicily, word arrived to the fleet that alcibiades was to be arrested and charged with sacrilege of the statues of hermes, prompting alcibiades to flee to sparta"
"when the fleet later landed in sicily and the battle was joined, the expedition was a complete disaster"
the entire expeditionary force was lost and nicias was captured and executed. this was one of the most crushing defeats in the history of athens
"alcibiades in sparta meanwhile, alcibiades betrayed athens and became a chief advisor to the spartans and began to counsel them on the best way to defeat his native land"
alcibiades persuaded the spartans to begin building a real navy for the first time—large enough to challenge the athenian superiority at sea
"additionally, alcibiades persuaded the spartans to ally themselves with their traditional foes—the persians"
"as noted below, alcibiades soon found himself in controversy in sparta when he was accused of having seduced timaea, the wife of agis ii, the eurypontid king of sparta"
"accordingly, alcibiades was required to flee from sparta and seek the protection of the persian court"
"persia intervenes in the persian court, alcibiades now betrayed both athens and sparta"
"he encouraged persia to give sparta financial aid to build a navy, advising that long and continuous warfare between sparta and athens would weaken both city-states and allow the persians to dominate the greek peninsula"
"among the war party in athens, a belief arose that the catastrophic defeat of the military expedition to sicily in 415–413 could have been avoided if alcibiades had been allowed to lead the expedition"
"thus, despite his treacherous flight to sparta and his collaboration with sparta and later with the persian court, there arose a demand among the war party that alcibiades be allowed to return to athens without being arrested"
"alcibiades negotiated with his supporters on the athenian-controlled island of samos. alcibiades felt that ""radical democracy"" was his worst enemy"
"accordingly, he asked his supporters to initiate a coup to establish an oligarchy in athens"
if the coup were successful alcibiades promised to return to athens
"in 411, a successful oligarchic coup was mounted in athens, by a group which became known as ""the 400"""
"however, a parallel attempt by the 400 to overthrow democracy in samos failed. alcibiades was immediately made an admiral  in the athenian navy"
"later, due to democratic pressures, the 400 were replaced by a broader oligarchy called ""the 5000"". alcibiades did not immediately return to athens"
"in early 410, alcibiades led an athenian fleet of 18 triremes against the persian-financed spartan fleet at abydos near the hellespont"
"the battle of abydos had actually begun before the arrival of alcibiades, and had been inclining slightly toward the athenians"
"however, with the arrival of alcibiades, the athenian victory over the spartans became a rout"
only the approach of nightfall and the movement of persian troops to the coast where the spartans had beached their ships saved the spartan navy from total destruction
"following alcibiades' advice, the persian empire had been playing sparta and athens off against each other"
"however, as weak as the spartan navy was after the battle of abydos, the persian navy directly assisted the spartans"
"alcibiades then pursued and met the combined spartan and persian fleets at the battle of cyzicus later in the spring of 410, achieving a significant victory"
"lysander and the end of the war with the financial help of the persians, sparta built a fleet to challenge athenian naval supremacy"
"with the new fleet and new military leader lysander, sparta attacked abydos, seizing the strategic initiative"
"by occupying the hellespont, the source of athens' grain imports, sparta effectively threatened athens with starvation"
"in response, athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront lysander, but were decisively defeated at aegospotami"
the loss of her fleet threatened athens with bankruptcy
"in 404 bc athens sued for peace, and sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: athens lost her city walls, her fleet, and all of her overseas possessions"
"lysander abolished the democracy and appointed in its place an oligarchy called the ""thirty tyrants"" to govern athens"
"meanwhile, in sparta, timaea gave birth to a child"
"the child was given the name leotychidas, after the great grandfather of agis ii—king leotychidas of sparta"
"however, because of timaea's alleged affair with alcibiades, it was widely rumoured that the young leotychidas was fathered by alcibiades"
"indeed, agis ii refused to acknowledge leotychidas as his son until he relented, in front of witnesses, on his deathbed in 400 bc"
"upon the death of agis ii, leotychidas attempted to claim the eurypontid throne for himself, but this was met with an outcry, led by lysander, who was at the height of his influence in sparta"
"lysander argued that leotychidas was a bastard and could not inherit the eurypontid throne; instead he backed the hereditary claim of agesilaus, son of agis by another wife"
"with lysander's support, agesilaus became the eurypontid king as agesilaus ii, expelled leotychidas from the country, and took over all of agis' estates and property"
"related articles: spartan hegemony and theban hegemonythe end of the peloponnesian war left sparta the master of greece, but the narrow outlook of the spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role"
within a few years the democratic party regained power in athens and in other cities
"in 395 bc the spartan rulers removed lysander from office, and sparta lost her naval supremacy"
"athens, argos, thebes, and corinth, the latter two former spartan allies, challenged sparta's dominance in the corinthian war, which ended inconclusively in 387 bc"
that same year sparta shocked the greeks by concluding the treaty of antalcidas with persia
"the agreement turned over the greek cities of ionia and cyprus, reversing a hundred years of greek victories against persia"
"sparta then tried to further weaken the power of thebes, which led to a war in which thebes allied with its old enemy athens"
then the theban generals epaminondas and pelopidas won a decisive victory at leuctra
"the result of this battle was the end of spartan supremacy and the establishment of theban dominance, but athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of thebes was short-lived"
with the death of epaminondas at mantinea  the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with phocis
"in 346 bc the thebans appealed to philip ii of macedon to help them against the phocians, thus drawing macedon into greek affairs for the first time"
the peloponnesian war was a radical turning point for the greek world
"before 403 bc, the situation was more defined, with athens and its allies , and other states outside this athenian empire"
the sources denounce this athenian supremacy  as smothering and disadvantageous
"after 403 bc, things became more complicated, with a number of cities trying to create similar empires over others, all of which proved short-lived"
"the first of these turnarounds was managed by athens as early as 390 bc, allowing it to re-establish itself as a major power without regaining its former glory"
this empire was powerful but short-lived
"in 405 bc, the spartans were masters of all—of athens' allies and of athens itself—and their power was undivided"
"by the end of the century, they could not even defend their own city. as noted above, in 400 bc, agesilaus became king of sparta"
foundation of a spartan empire the subject of how to reorganize the athenian empire as part of the spartan empire provoked much heated debate among sparta's full citizens
the admiral lysander felt that the spartans should rebuild the athenian empire in such a way that sparta profited from it
lysander tended to be too proud to take advice from others
"prior to this, spartan law forbade the use of all precious metals by private citizens, with transactions being carried out with cumbersome iron ingots  and all precious metals obtained by the city becoming state property"
"without the spartans' support, lysander's innovations came into effect and brought a great deal of profit for him—on samos, for example, festivals known as lysandreia were organized in his honour"
"he was recalled to sparta, and once there did not attend to any important matters. sparta refused to see lysander or his successors dominate"
"not wanting to establish a hegemony, they decided after 403 bc not to support the directives that he had made"
agesilaus came to power by accident at the start of the 4th century bc
"this accidental accession meant that, unlike the other spartan kings, he had the advantage of a spartan education"
the spartans at this date discovered a conspiracy against the laws of the city conducted by cinadon and as a result concluded there were too many dangerous worldly elements at work in the spartan state
agesilaus employed a political dynamic that played on a feeling of pan-hellenic sentiment and launched a successful campaign against the persian empire
"once again, the persian empire played both sides against each other"
"the persian court supported sparta in the rebuilding of their navy while simultaneously funding the athenians, who used persian subsidies to rebuild their long walls  as well as to reconstruct their fleet and win a number of victories"
"for most of the first years of his reign, agesilaus had been engaged in a war against persia in the aegean sea and in asia minor"
"in 394 bc, the spartan authorities ordered agesilaus to return to mainland greece"
"while agesilaus had a large part of the spartan army in asia minor, the spartan forces protecting the homeland had been attacked by a coalition of forces led by corinth"
at the battle of haliartus the spartans had been defeated by the theban forces
"worse yet, lysander, sparta's chief military leader, had been killed during the battle"
"this was the start of what became known as the ""corinthian war"""
"upon hearing of the spartan loss at haliartus and of the death of lysander, agesilaus headed out of asia minor, back across the hellespont, across thrace and back towards greece"
"at the battle of coronea, agesilaus and his spartan army defeated a theban force"
"during the war, corinth drew support from a coalition of traditional spartan enemies—argos, athens and thebes"
"however, when the war descended into guerilla tactics, sparta decided that it could not fight on two fronts and so chose to ally with persia"
"the long corinthian war finally ended with the peace of antalcidas or the king's peace, in which the ""great king"" of persia, artaxerxes ii, pronounced a ""treaty"" of peace between the various city-states of greece which broke up all ""leagues"" of city-states on greek mainland and in the islands of the aegean sea"
"although this was looked upon as ""independence"" for some city-states, the effect of the unilateral ""treaty"" was highly favourable to the interests of the persian empire"
the corinthian war revealed a significant dynamic that was occurring in greece
"while athens and sparta fought each other to exhaustion, thebes was rising to a position of dominance among the various greek city-states"
"the peace of antalcidas in 387 bc, an edict was promulgated by the persian king, preserving the greek cities of asia minor and cyprus as well as the independence of the greek aegean cities, except for lymnos, imbros and skyros, which were given over to athens"
it dissolved existing alliances and federations and forbade the formation of new ones
this is an ultimatum that benefited athens only to the extent that athens held onto three islands
"while the ""great king,"" artaxerxes, was the guarantor of the peace, sparta was to act as persia's agent in enforcing the peace"
"to the persians this document is known as the ""king's peace"
""" to the greeks, this document is known as the peace of antalcidas, after the spartan diplomat antalcidas who was sent to persia as negotiator"
sparta had been worried about the developing closer ties between athens and persia
"accordingly, antalcidas was directed to get whatever agreement he could from the ""great king"""
"accordingly, the ""peace of antalcidas"" is not a negotiated peace at all"
"rather it is a surrender to the interests of persia, drafted entirely for its benefit"
"spartan interventionism on the other hand, this peace had unexpected consequences"
"in accordance with it, the boeotian league, or boeotian confederacy, was dissolved in 386 bc"
"this confederacy was dominated by thebes, a city hostile to the spartan hegemony"
"sparta carried out large-scale operations and peripheral interventions in epirus and in the north of greece, resulting in the capture of the fortress of thebes, the cadmea, after an expedition in the chalcidice and the capture of olynthos"
it was a theban politician who suggested to the spartan general phoibidas that sparta should seize thebes itself
"this act was sharply condemned, though sparta eagerly ratified this unilateral move by phoibidas"
the spartan attack was successful and thebes was placed under spartan control
"clash with thebes in 378 bc, the reaction to spartan control over thebes was broken by a popular uprising within thebes"
"elsewhere in greece, the reaction against spartan hegemony began when sphodrias, another spartan general, tried to carry out a surprise attack on piraeus"
"although the gates of piraeus were no longer fortified, sphodrias was driven off before piraeus"
"back in sparta, sphodrias was put on trial for the failed attack, but was acquitted by the spartan court"
"nonetheless, the attempted attack triggered an alliance between athens and thebes. sparta would now have to fight them both together"
"athens was trying to recover from its defeat in the peloponnesian war at the hands of sparta's ""navarch"" lysander in the disaster of 404 bc"
the rising spirit of rebellion against sparta also fueled thebes' attempt to restore the former boeotian confederacy
"in boeotia, the theban leaders pelopidas and epaminondas reorganized the theban army and began to free the towns of boeotia from their spartan garrisons, one by one, and incorporated these towns into the revived boeotian league"
pelopidas won a great victory for thebes over a much larger spartan force in the battle of tegyra in 375 bc
theban authority grew so spectacularly in such a short time that athens came to mistrust the growing theban power
athens began to consolidate its position again through the formation of a second athenian league
"attention was drawn to growing power of thebes when it began interfering in the political affairs of its neighbor, phocis, and, particularly, after thebes razed the city of plataea, a long-standing ally of athens, in 375 bc"
"the destruction of plataea caused athens to negotiate an alliance with sparta against thebes, in that same year"
"in 371, the theban army, led by epaminondas, inflicted a bloody defeat on spartan forces at battle of leuctra"
"sparta lost a large part of its army and 400 of its 2,000 citizen-troops. the battle of leuctra was a watershed in greek history"
epaminondas' victory ended a long history of spartan military prestige and dominance over greece and the period of spartan hegemony was over
"however, spartan hegemony was not replaced by theban, but rather by athenian hegemony"
financing the league it was important to erase the bad memories of the former league
"its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid"
"instead, syntaxeis were used, irregular contributions as and when athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible"
"these contributions were not taken to athens—unlike the 5th century bc system, there was no central exchequer for the league—but to the athenian generals themselves"
"the athenians had to make their own contribution to the alliance, the eisphora"
"they reformed how this tax was paid, creating a system in advance, the proseiphora, in which the richest individuals had to pay the whole sum of the tax then be reimbursed by other contributors"
this system was quickly assimilated into a liturgy. athenian hegemony halted this league responded to a real and present need
"on the ground, however, the situation within the league proved to have changed little from that of the 5th century bc, with athenian generals doing what they wanted and able to extort funds from the league"
alliance with athens again looked unattractive and the allies complained. the main reasons for the eventual failure were structural
"this alliance was only valued out of fear of sparta, which evaporated after sparta's fall in 371 bc, losing the alliance its sole 'raison d'etre'"
"the athenians no longer had the means to fulfill their ambitions, and found it difficult merely to finance their own navy, let alone that of an entire alliance, and so could not properly defend their allies"
"thus, the tyrant of pherae was able to destroy a number of cities with impunity"
"from 360 bc, athens lost its reputation for invincibility and a number of allies  decided to secede"
"in 357 bc the revolt against the league spread, and between 357 bc and 355 bc, athens had to face war against its allies—a war whose issue was marked by a decisive intervention by the king of persia in the form of an ultimatum to athens, demanding that athens recognise its allies' independence under threat of persia's sending 200 triremes against athens"
"athens had to renounce the war and leave the confederacy, thereby weakening itself more and more, and signaling the end of athenian hegemony"
5th century bc boeotian confederacy  this was not thebes' first attempt at hegemony
"it had been the most important city of boeotia and the centre of the previous boeotian confederacy of 447, resurrected since 386"
"the 5th-century confederacy is well known to us from a papyrus found at oxyrhynchus and known as ""the anonyme of thebes"""
thebes headed it and set up a system under which charges were divided up between the different cities of the confederacy
"citizenship was defined according to wealth, and thebes counted 11,000 active citizens"
"the confederacy was divided up into 11 districts, each providing a federal magistrate called a ""boeotarch"", a certain number of council members, 1,000 hoplites and 100 horsemen"
"from the 5th century bc the alliance could field an infantry force of 11,000 men, in addition to an elite corps and a light infantry numbering 10,000; but its real power derived from its cavalry force of 1,100, commanded by a federal magistrate independent of local commanders"
it also had a small fleet that played a part in the peloponnesian war by providing 25 triremes for the spartans
"at the end of the conflict, the fleet consisted of 50 triremes and was commanded by a ""navarch"""
all this constituted a significant enough force that the spartans were happy to see the boeotian confederacy dissolved by the king's peace
"this dissolution, however, did not last, and in the 370s there was nothing to stop the thebans  from reforming this confederacy"
"theban reconstruction pelopidas and epaminondas endowed thebes with democratic institutions similar to those of athens, the thebans revived the title of ""boeotarch"" lost in the persian king's peace and—with victory at leuctra and the destruction of spartan power—the pair achieved their stated objective of renewing the confederacy"
"epaminondas rid the peloponnesus of pro-spartan oligarchies, replacing them with pro-theban democracies, constructed cities, and rebuilt a number of those destroyed by sparta"
he equally supported the reconstruction of the city of messene thanks to an invasion of laconia that also allowed him to liberate the helots and give them messene as a capital
"he decided in the end to constitute small confederacies all round the peloponnessus, forming an arcadian confederacy"
confrontation between athens and thebes the strength of the boeotian league explains athens' problems with her allies in the second athenian league
epaminondas succeeded in convincing his countrymen to build a fleet of 100 triremes to pressure cities into leaving the athenian league and joining a boeotian maritime league
epaminondas and pelopidas also reformed the army of thebes to introduce new and more effective means of fighting
"thus, the theban army was able to carry the day against the coalition of other greek states at the battle of leuctra in 371 bc and the battle of mantinea in 362 bc"
sparta also remained an important power in the face of theban strength
"however, some of the cities allied with sparta turned against her, because of thebes"
"in 367 bc, both sparta and athens sent delegates to artaxerxes ii, the great king of persia"
"these delegates sought to have the artaxerxes, once again, declare greek independence and a unilateral common peace, just as he had done in twenty years earlier in 387 bc"
"as noted above, this had meant the destruction of the boeotian league in 387 bc"
"sparta and athens now hoped the same thing would happen with a new declaration of a similar ""kings peace"""
thebes sent pelopidas to argue against them
"the great king was convinced by pelopidas and the theban diplomats that thebes and the boeotian league would be the best agents of persian interests in greece, and, accordingly, did not issue a new ""king's peace"
""" thus, to deal with thebes, athens and sparta were thrown back on their own resources"
"thebes, meanwhile, expanded its influence beyond the bounds of boeotia"
"in 364 bc, pelopidas defeated the alexander of pherae in the battle of cynoscephalae, located in south-eastern thessaly in northern greece"
"however, during the battle, pelopides was killed"
"the confederational framework of sparta's relationship with her allies was really an artificial one, since it attempted to bring together cities that had never been able to agree on much at all in the past"
"such was the case with the cities of tegea and mantinea, which re-allied in the arcadian confederacy"
"the mantineans received the support of the athenians, and the tegeans that of the thebans"
"in 362 bc, epaminondas led a theban army against a coalition of athenian, spartan, elisian, mantinean and achean forces"
battle was joined at mantinea
"the thebans prevailed, but this triumph was short-lived, for epaminondas died in the battle, stating that ""i bequeath to thebes two daughters, the victory of leuctra and the victory at mantinea"""
"despite the victory at mantinea, in the end, the thebans abandoned their policy of intervention in the peloponnesus"
"this event is looked upon as a watershed in greek history. thus, xenophon concludes his history of the greek world at this point, in 362 bc"
the end of this period was even more confused than its beginning
"greece had failed and, according to xenophon, the history of the greek world was no longer intelligible. the idea of hegemony disappeared"
"the idea of hegemony disappeared. from 362 bc onward, there was no longer a single city that could exert hegemonic power in greece"
"the spartans were greatly weakened; the athenians were in no condition to operate their navy, and after 365 no longer had any allies; thebes could only exert an ephemeral dominance, and had the means to defeat sparta and athens but not to be a major power in asia minor"
"other forces also intervened, such as the persian king, who appointed himself arbitrator among the greek cities, with their tacit agreement"
"this situation reinforced the conflicts and there was a proliferation of civil wars, with the confederal framework a repeated trigger for them"
"one war led to another, each longer and more bloody than the last, and the cycle could not be broken"
"hostilities even took place during winter for the first time, with the invasion of laconia in 370 bc"
thebes sought to maintain its position until finally eclipsed by the rising power of macedon in 346 bc
"the energetic leadership within macedon began in 359 bc when philip of macedon was made regent for his nephew, amyntas"
"within a short time, philip was acclaimed king as philip ii of macedonia in his own right, with succession of the throne established on his own heirs"
"during his lifetime, philip ii consolidated his rule over macedonia"
this was done by 359 bc and philip began to look toward expanding macedonia's influence abroad
"under philip ii, , macedon expanded into the territory of the paeonians, thracians, and illyrians"
"in 358 bc, philip allied with epirus in its campaign against illyria"
"in 357 bc, philip came into direct conflict with athens when he conquered the thracian port city of amphipolis, a city located at the mouth of the strymon river to the east of macedonia, and a major athenian trading port"
conquering this city allowed philip to subjugate all of thrace
"a year later in 356 bc, the macedonians attacked and conquered the athenian-controlled port city of pydna"
this brought the macedonian threat to athens closer to home to the athenians
"with the start of the phocian war in 356 bc, the great athenian orator and political leader of the ""war party"", demosthenes, became increasingly active in encouraging athens to fight vigorously against philip's expansionist aims"
"in 352 bc, demosthenes gave many speeches against the macedonian threat, declaring philip ii athens' greatest enemy"
"the leader of the athenian ""peace party"" was phocion, who wished to avoid a confrontation that, phocion felt, would be catastrophic for athens"
"despite phocion's attempts to restrain the war party, athens remained at war with macedonia for years following the original declaration of war"
negotiations between athens and philip ii started only in 346 bc
the athenians successfully halted philip's invasion of attica at thermopylae that same year in 352 bc
"however, philip defeated the phocians at the battle of the crocus field"
"the conflict between macedonia and all the city-states of greece came to a head in 338 bc, at the battle of chaeronea"
"the macedonians became more politically involved with the south-central city-states of greece, but also retained more archaic aspects harking back to the palace culture, first at aegae  then at pella, resembling mycenaean culture more than that of the classical city-states"
"militarily, philip recognized the new phalanx style of fighting that had been employed by epaminondas and pelopidas in thebes"
"accordingly, he incorporated this new system into the macedonian army"
philip ii also brought a theban military tutor to macedon to instruct the future alexander the great in the theban method of fighting
"philip's son alexander the great was born in pella, macedonia . philip ii brought aristotle to pella to teach the young alexander"
"besides alexander's mother, olympias, philip took another wife by the name of cleopatra eurydice"
"cleopatra had a daughter, europa, and a son, caranus. caranus posed a threat to the succession of alexander"
"cleopatra eurydice was a macedonian and, thus, caranus was all macedonian in blood"
"olympias, on the other hand, was from epirus and, thus, alexander was regarded as being only half-macedonian"
philip ii was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter cleopatra of macedon with king alexander i of epirus in 336 bc
"philip's son, the future alexander the great, immediately claimed the throne of macedonia by eliminating all the other claimants to the throne, including caranus and his cousin amytas"
"alexander was only twenty years of age when he assumed the throne.thereafter, alexander continued his father's plans to conquer all of greece"
"he did this by both military might and persuasion. after his victory over thebes, alexander traveled to athens to meet the public directly"
"despite demosthenes' speeches against the macedonian threat on behalf of the war party of athens, the public in athens was still very much divided between the ""peace party"" and demosthenes' ""war party"
""" however, the arrival of alexander charmed the athenian public"
the peace party was strengthened and then a peace between athens and macedonia was agreed
"this allowed alexander to move on his and the greeks' long-held dream of conquest in the east, with a unified and secure greek state at his back"
"in 334 bc, alexander with about 30,000 infantry soldiers and 5,000 cavalry crossed the hellespont into asia. he never returned"
"alexander managed to briefly extend macedonian power not only over the central greek city-states, but also to the persian empire, including egypt and lands as far east as the fringes of india"
he managed to spread greek culture throughout the known world. alexander the great died in 323 bc in babylon during his asian campaign of conquest
"the classical period conventionally ends at the death of alexander the great in 323 bc and the fragmentation of his empire, divided among the diadochi, which, in the minds of most scholars, marks the beginning of the hellenistic period"
"the legacy of greece was strongly felt by post-renaissance european elite, who saw themselves as the spiritual heirs of greece"
"will durant wrote in 1939 that ""excepting machinery, there is hardly anything secular in our culture that does not come from greece,"" and conversely ""there is nothing in greek civilization that doesn't illuminate our own"""
