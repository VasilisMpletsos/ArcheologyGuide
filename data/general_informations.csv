The findings allow the building to be dated to the Classical period. It is estimated back to around the middle of the fourth century. A monumental staircase led to the first floor, where the officials apartments were located. Room F seems that was used as a storage and for food preparation. The small underground room H was certainly a storeroom. Room D seems to have been a storage room."
