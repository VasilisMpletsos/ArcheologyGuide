"This building  was a cult building where the worship of the god Asklepios, the goddess Aphrodite and other Samothracian Gods was done.The walls of the building were plastered with red mortar which survives its original placement in some places, both internally and externally.It was a place where dinners were held.It has Doric portico, which in its original phase was single or more likely abolished, in Roman times by the construction of a transverse wall.In the southeast corner of the building is the opening of the water tank, carved into the natural rock."
"This building was a ancillary building to building one. It was used for religious purposes. A lot findings from the Geometric to Hellenistic times came to light from this building. It was dated to the late Classical to early Hellenistic times. During its excavation, a lot of pottery, figurines, lighting vessels and several animal bones were found. This area is important among other things because of the presence of many marble sculptures and also inscriptions."
"It is the most important excavated complex in the area of the ancient city. This is the Sanctuary of the Middle Plateau. It is a sanctuary of the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic times. It was probably dedicated to the sister deities Apollo and Artemis. The most valuable findings there where dated from archaic times. Both the wealth and the varied and exotic origins of the finds lead to the the importance and radiance of the sanctuary. It is a rectangular Doric building in the Doric style made of slate. Gold, silver, copper, jewelry and various types of periaptas were found inside the shelter of the temple of Kythnos."
"This building was probably used as the market of Hellenistic times. It was a building of a public, perhaps even commercial character. The findings allow the building to be dated to the Classical period. It is estimated back to around the middle of the fourth century. A monumental staircase led to the first floor, where the officials apartments were located. Room F seems that was used as a storage and for food preparation. The small underground room H was certainly a storeroom. Room D seems to have been a storage room."
"At the top of the Acropolis, an important sanctuary occupies a dominant position, which, as surface finds show, was in use from the end of the 8th BC up to the 1st AD. After excavation in the summer of 2021, the remains of at least 4 buildings came to light (buildings three to six). The type of finds led to the safe conclusion that the sanctuary was dedicated to the worship of both Demeter and Kore. Building three, twenty one meters long and eight point five meters wide, with trapezoidal masonry and a monumental entrance in the middle of the elongated North wall, dates to the classical period. The bilateral Building four, measuring seven point five by seven point five meters, is matched with the temple of the classical times. Western Building six is configured internally on at least three stepped levels, probably to serve cult purposes. East Building five, measuring three point eight by three point eight meters, contained as a filling under its floor many intact lamps from the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods, as well as various votive offerings. Between the main temple and Buildings five and three, a rampart is formed with an entrance from the east, which defined at some point, during the long course of use of the sanctuary (7th century BC to 3rd 4th century AD) a extensive depository containing innumerable votives."
"From 2018 to 2020, excavation work continued on the islet of Vryokastraki, a site with continuous habitation from the 10th century BC to the 7th century AD and sporadic indications of human presence during the 12th century BC. Clear indications of a Cycladic settlement was found. The initial findings indicate that the core of the original habitation of the ancient city was the rock island. The rocky islet, must have been connected to the coast by a narrow isthmus. A three-aisled early Christian basilica was also excavated."
"The three-aisled Early Christian basilica is the latest building of a religious nature in the ancient city until today. Three main phases can be distinguished from the monument complex construction, the one where the separation of the aisles is done with alternating pessos and columns is noted, as well as the last one where the transoms are sealed leaving small passages between the aisles. Marble members were used as spolia in the building, such as facings of ancient monuments, pedestals, propellers of an Ionic colonnade probably of Archaic times and a table in two fragments with a lion's foot finial. Two fragmentarily preserved inscriptions were found,the one dating from the beginning of the 4th century BC, the other engraved on a tabula ansata honoring the emperor Vespasian or Domitian of the 1st century AD. Important items were also discovered, such as a marble colonnade, a circular marble table, a part of an iron cross, a bronze candelabrum with a hanging chain from the second half of the 6th century to early 7th century and lead beaker with incised decoration and tall foot.Under the disturbed floor of the apse, a layer of broken Early Byzantine vessels came to light, such as short pots, Late Roman Amphora 2 and mainly a large number of fragments from the body of cylindrical amphorae of the Late Roman Amphora 1 type, dating mainly to the 6th century and the beginning of the 7th. Under the layer on the longitudinal axis of the temple, a small rectangular excavation in the natural rock was revealed in the form of a case with a covering plate. The basilica was in operation at least until the 7th century, without excluding its later use."
