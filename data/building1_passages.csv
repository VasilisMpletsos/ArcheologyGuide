"it is possible that the building also housed the worship of the samothracian gods, based on an inscribed stele found embedded in a newer building"
"it is an oblong building with dimensions of seventeen point fourty Ã— eleven point fifty meters, made of slate, which consists of two independent rooms opening to the east on a doric portico, from which the building was accessed"
"it is erected on a strong rise in the west, with a maximum surviving height of two point eighty meters"
"the walls of the building were plastered with red mortar which survives its original placement in some places, both internally and externally"
"regarding the internal layout of the rooms, the northernmost room preserves a large part of the pebbled floor"
"in contact with the wall on the north-east side, a three-meter raised strip is also preserved, consisting of smaller pebbles"
"according to the excavator, the different configuration of the pebbles in contact with the wall is a clear indication of the placement of couches around the perimeter of the walls, possibly for holding dinners or for sleeping"
"the smaller space c preserves the foundation of a pedestal, measuring one twenty x zero eighty meters, probably intended to support a cult statue"

the water was directed from the roof to the collector and ended up in the tank through a pipe
"the interior of both the collector and the tank was covered with hydraulic mortar, making the tank watertight"
"the proximity of the reservoir to the building attests to the inseparable relationship between the two and that the water collected was intended for the needs of the sanctuary, while the collector could also serve as a purification tank"
