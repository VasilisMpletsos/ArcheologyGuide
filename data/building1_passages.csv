passages
"the southernmost one (building one) is a cult building in which, based on the sculptures and inscriptions that emerged from both the interior of the building and the adjacent reservoir, the worship of the god asklepios and the goddess aphrodite was housed"
"it is possible that the building also housed the worship of the samothracian gods, based on an inscribed stele found embedded in a newer building"
"it is an oblong building with dimensions of seventeen point fourty × eleven point fifty meters, made of slate, which consists of two independent rooms opening to the east on a doric portico, from which the building was accessed"
"it is erected on a strong rise in the west, with a maximum surviving height of two point eighty meters"
"the walls of the building were plastered with red mortar which survives its original placement in some places, both internally and externally"
"regarding the internal layout of the rooms, the northernmost room preserves a large part of the pebbled floor"
"in contact with the wall on the north-east side, a three-meter raised strip is also preserved, consisting of smaller pebbles"
"according to the excavator, the different configuration of the pebbles in contact with the wall is a clear indication of the placement of couches around the perimeter of the walls, possibly for holding dinners or for sleeping"
"the smaller space c preserves the foundation of a pedestal, measuring one twenty x zero eighty meters, probably intended to support a cult statue"
"the doric portico, which in its original phase was single, was divided, or more likely abolished, in roman times by the construction of a transverse wall, aligned with the intermediate wall of rooms a and c, changing the layout of the building and by extension dividing the in two separate buildings"
"in contact with the pilaster, in the southeast corner of the building is the opening of the ugly water tank, carved into the natural rock"
"the filling of the tank was achieved through an overflow channel, which connected the tank to the collector (one twenty meters deep and one meter in diameter) located south and in contact with that of the tank"
the water was directed from the roof to the collector and ended up in the tank through a pipe
"the interior of both the collector and the tank was covered with hydraulic mortar, making the tank watertight"
"the proximity of the reservoir to the building attests to the inseparable relationship between the two and that the water collected was intended for the needs of the sanctuary, while the collector could also serve as a purification tank"
"at the same time, important finds came from the tank, such as a marble head of asclepius from the late hellenistic period, as well as an inscribed colonnade of the first second century, dedicated to asclepius by a certain callisto, while fragments of marble child figurines came from, a category of votives found in sanctuaries of the god asclepius"
"also collected were a small head of aphrodite from the hellenistic period, and a clay head of demeter from a large figurine from the late classical period"
"remarkable, finally, is the presence within the reservoir, towards the deeper layers of the excavated embankment, two human femurs whose dating has not yet been determined"
"in addition to the finds from the interior of the cistern, findings such as a votive inscription to aphrodite syria, built into the intermediate wall of building one in second use, a marble statue of aphrodite and the lower part of a marble female of a statue that had been found a short distance lower than buildings one and two, and probably belonged according to panagiotis themelis to the colossal statue of aphrodite in the anadyomeni type, which was crafted by the messenian sculptor damophon i make clear the co-cult of asclepius and aphrodite"
this building is dated to the late classical to early hellenistic times
"from the surface survey, numerous objects were collected that indicate the cultic function of the plateau"
"examining the sanctuaries of the city as a whole, the habit of worshiping two or more deities is observed"
the earliest vessels of the sanctuary bear written decoration
fourty seven fragments of vessels with written decorations were found from different time periods
the earliest ceramic evidence from the building belongs to the protogeometric period
"most of the fragments belong to the middle and late geometric, and the largest percentage of them came from the pities layer"
"the majority of shells, belonging to closed shapes of the geometric period, bear linear decoration"
"fewer in number are the vessels of the archaic and classical periods with written decoration, mainly large open vessels, such as kraters and basins, but also smaller ones, such as bowls and basketsdue to the monumental preservation of the buildings, the local legend developed that the palace of riga was located here"
"it is build from slate, limestone and shell stone.asclepius  is a hero and god of medicine in ancient greek religion and mythology"
"he is the son of apollo and coronis, or arsinoe, or of apollo alone"
"asclepius represents the healing aspect of the medical arts; his daughters, the ""asclepiades"", are: hygieia , iaso , aceso , aegle  and panacea"
he has several sons as well. he was associated with the roman/etruscan god vediovis and the egyptian imhotep
"he shared with apollo the epithet paean . the rod of asclepius, a snake-entwined staff,  remains a symbol of medicine today"
those physicians and attendants who served this god were known as the therapeutae of asclepius. the etymology of the name is unknown
"the etymology of the name is unknown. in his revised version of frisk's griechisches etymologisches wörterbuch , r.s.p"
"s.p. beekes gives this summary of the different attempts: ""h"
"grégoire  in asklépios, apollon smintheus et rudra 1949 , explains the name as ""the mole-hero"", connecting σκάλοψ, ἀσπάλαξ 'mole' and refers to the resemblance of the tholos in epidauros and the building of a mole"
"but the variants of asklepios and those of the word for ""mole"" do not agree"
"the name is typical for pre-greek words; apart from minor variations  for λα) we find α/αι  followed by -γλαπ- or -σκλαπ-/-σχλαπ/β-, i.e"
"e. a voiced velar  or a voiceless velar  with a -σ-. i think that the -σ- renders an original affricate, which  was lost before the -γ-"
"szemerényi's etymology  from hitt. assula- ""well-being"" and piya- ""give"" cannot be correct, as it does not explain the velar"
"""beekes suggested a pre-greek proto-form *atyklap-.his name may mean ""to cut open"" from a story about his birth"
"asclepius was the son of apollo and, according to the earliest accounts, a mortal woman named koronis , who was a princess of tricca in thessaly"
"when she displayed infidelity by sleeping with a mortal named ischys, apollo realised this with his prophetic powers and killed ischys"
"coronis was killed by artemis for being unfaithful to apollo and was laid out on a funeral pyre to be consumed, but apollo rescued the child by cutting him from coronis' womb"
"according to delphian tradition, asclepius was born in the temple of apollo, with lachesis acting as a midwife and apollo relieving the pains of coronis"
"apollo named the child after coronis' nickname, aegle.phoenician tradition maintains that asclepius was born of apollo without any woman involved"
"according to the roman version, apollo, having learned about coronis' betrayal with the mortal ischys through his raven lycius, killed her with his arrows"
"before breathing her last, she revealed to apollo that she was pregnant with his child. he repented his actions and unsuccessfully tried to save her"
"at last, he removed their son safely from her belly before she was consumed by the fire"
"in yet another version, coronis who was already pregnant with apollo's child, had to accompany her father to peloponnesos"
"she had kept her pregnancy hidden from her father. in epidaurus, she bore a son and exposed him on a mountain called tittheion"
"the child was given milk by one of the goats that pastured about the mountain, and was guarded by the watch-dog of the herd"
"aresthanas, the owner of goats and the guard dogs found the child"
"as he came near, he saw lightning that flashed from the child, and thinking of it to be a sign of the divine, he left the child alone"
"asclepius was later taken by apollo.according to strabo and other traditions, the birthplace of asclepius is considered to be tricca"
"apollo named the rescued baby ""asclepius"" and reared him for a while and taught him many things about medicine"
"however, like his half-brother, aristaeus, asclepius had his formal education under the centaur chiron who instructed him in the art of medicine"
"it is said that in return for some kindness rendered by asclepius, a snake licked asclepius's ears clean and taught him secret knowledge"
"asclepius bore a rod wreathed with a snake, which became associated with healing"
"another version states that when asclepius  was commanded to restore the life of glaucus, he was confined in a secret prison"
"while pondering on what he should do, a snake crept near his staff"
"lost in his thoughts, asclepius unknowingly killed it by hitting it again and again with his staff"
"later, another snake came there with an herb in its mouth, and placed it on the head of a dead snake, which soon came back to life"
"seeing this, asclepius used the same herb, which brought glaucus back"
"a species of non-venomous pan-mediterranean serpent, the aesculapian snake  is named for the god"
"he was originally called hepius but received his popular name of asclepius after he cured ascles, ruler of epidaurus who suffered an incurable ailment in his eyes"
"asclepius became so proficient as a healer that he surpassed both chiron and his father, apollo"
asclepius was therefore able to evade death and to bring others back to life from the brink of death and beyond
"this caused an excessive abundance of human beings, and zeus resorted to killing him to maintain balance in the numbers of the human population"
"at some point, asclepius was among those who took part in the calydonian boar hunt"
"asclepius was married to epione, with whom he had five daughters: hygieia, panacea, aceso, iaso, and aegle, and three sons: machaon, podaleirios and telesphoros"
"he also sired a son, aratus, with aristodeme"
"asclepius once started bringing back to life the dead people like tyndareus, capaneus, glaucus, hymenaeus, lycurgus and others"
"others say he brought hippolytus back from the dead on artemis' request, and accepted gold for it"
it is the only mention of asclepius resurrecting the dead. in all other accounts he is said to use his skills simply as a physician
"however, hades accused asclepius of stealing his subjects and complained to his brother zeus about it"
"according to others, zeus was afraid that asclepius would teach the art of resurrection to other humans as well"
so he killed asclepius with his thunderbolt. this angered apollo who in turn killed the cyclopes who made the thunderbolts for zeus
"for this act, zeus banished apollo from olympus and commanded him to serve admetus, king of thessaly, for a year"
"after asclepius's death, zeus placed his body among the stars as the constellation ophiuchus"
"later, however, upon apollo's request, zeus resurrected asclepius as a god and gave him a place on olympus"
"the most ancient and the most prominent asclepeion  according to the geographer of the 1st century bc, strabo, was situated in trikala"
"the 1st century ad pool of bethesda, described in the gospel of john, chapter 5, was found by archaeologists in 1964 to be part of an asclepeion"
"one of the most famous temples of asclepius was at epidaurus in north-eastern peloponnese, dated to the fourth century bc"
"another famous asclepeion was built approximately a century later on the island of kos, where hippocrates, the legendary ""father of medicine"", may have begun his career"
"other asclepieia were situated in gortys , and pergamum in asia"
"from the fifth century bc onwards, the cult of asclepius grew very popular and pilgrims flocked to his healing temples  to be cured of their ills"
"ritual purification would be followed by offerings or sacrifices to the god , and the supplicant would then spend the night in the holiest part of the sanctuary– the abaton"
any dreams or visions would be reported to a priest who would prescribe the appropriate therapy by a process of interpretation
some healing temples also used sacred dogs to lick the wounds of sick petitioners
"in honor of asclepius, a particular type of non-venomous snake was often used in healing rituals, and these snakes— the aesculapian snakes— slithered around freely on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept"
these snakes were introduced at the founding of each new temple of asclepius throughout the classical world
"the original hippocratic oath began with the invocation ""i swear by apollo the physician and by asclepius and by hygieia and panacea and by all the gods"
".."".epidauria  was a festival at athens in honour of asclepius.some later religious movements claimed links to asclepius"
"in the 2nd century ad the controversial miracle-worker alexander claimed that his god glycon, a snake with a ""head of linen"" was an incarnation of asclepius"
the greek language rhetorician and satirist lucian produced the work alexander the false prophet to denounce the swindler for future generations
"he described alexander as having a character ""made up of lying, trickery, perjury, and malice;  facile, audacious, venturesome, diligent in the execution of its schemes, plausible, convincing, masking as good, and wearing an appearance absolutely opposite to its purpose"
""" in rome, the college of aesculapius and hygia was an association  that served as a burial society and dining club that also participated in the imperial cult"
"the botanical genus asclepias  is named after him and includes the medicinal plant a. tuberosa or ""pleurisy root"""
"tuberosa or ""pleurisy root"". asclepius was depicted on the reverse of the greek 10,000 drachmas banknote of 1995–2001"
"at the city of miletus, archaeologists discovered a cave under the city's theatre which was associated with asclepius cult"
"aphrodite  af-rə-dy-tee; greek: ἀφροδίτη, translit"
"aphrodítē; attic greek pronunciation: ) is an ancient greek goddess associated with love, lust, beauty, pleasure, passion, procreation, and as her syncretized roman goddess counterpart venus, desire, sex, fertility, prosperity, and victory"
"aphrodite's major symbols include seashells, myrtles, roses, doves, sparrows, and swans"
"the cult of aphrodite was largely derived from that of the phoenician goddess astarte, a cognate of the east semitic goddess ishtar, whose cult was based on the sumerian cult of inanna"
"aphrodite's main cult centers were cythera, cyprus, corinth, and athens"
"her main festival was the aphrodisia, which was celebrated annually in midsummer. in laconia, aphrodite was worshipped as a warrior goddess"
"she was also the patron goddess of prostitutes, an association which led early scholars to propose the concept of ""sacred prostitution"" in greco-roman culture, an idea which is now generally seen as erroneous"
"in hesiod's theogony, aphrodite is born off the coast of cythera from the foam  produced by uranus's genitals, which his son cronus had severed and thrown into the sea"
"in homer's iliad, however, she is the daughter of zeus and dione"
"plato, in his symposium, asserts that these two origins actually belong to separate entities: aphrodite urania  and aphrodite pandemos"
"aphrodite had many other epithets, each emphasizing a different aspect of the same goddess, or used by a different local cult"
"thus she was also known as cytherea  and cypris , because both locations claimed to be the place of her birth"
"in greek mythology, aphrodite was married to hephaestus, the god of fire, blacksmiths and metalworking"
"aphrodite was frequently unfaithful to him and had many lovers; in the odyssey, she is caught in the act of adultery with ares, the god of war"
"in the first homeric hymn to aphrodite, she seduces the mortal shepherd anchises"
"aphrodite was also the surrogate mother and lover of the mortal shepherd adonis, who was killed by a wild boar"
"along with athena and hera, aphrodite was one of the three goddesses whose feud resulted in the beginning of the trojan war and she plays a major role throughout the iliad"
aphrodite has been featured in western art as a symbol of female beauty and has appeared in numerous works of western literature
"she is a major deity in modern neopagan religions, including the church of aphrodite, wicca, and hellenismos"
"hesiod derives aphrodite from aphrós  ""sea-foam"", interpreting the name as ""risen from the foam"", but most modern scholars regard this as a spurious folk etymology"
"early modern scholars of classical mythology attempted to argue that aphrodite's name was of greek or indo-european origin, but these efforts have now been mostly abandoned"
"aphrodite's name is generally accepted to be of non-greek, probably semitic, origin, but its exact derivation cannot be determined"
"scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, accepting hesiod's ""foam"" etymology as genuine, analyzed the second part of aphrodite's name as *-odítē ""wanderer"" or *-dítē ""bright"""
"more recently, michael janda, also accepting hesiod's etymology, has argued in favor of the latter of these interpretations and claims the story of a birth from the foam as an indo-european mytheme"
"similarly, krzysztof tomasz witczak proposes an indo-european compound *abʰor- ""very"" and *dʰei- ""to shine"", also referring to eos, and daniel kölligan has interpreted her name as ""shining up from the mist/foam"""
other scholars have argued that these hypotheses are unlikely since aphrodite's attributes are entirely different from those of both eos and the vedic deity ushas
a number of improbable non-greek etymologies have also been suggested
"one semitic etymology compares aphrodite to the assyrian barīrītu, the name of a female demon that appears in middle babylonian and late babylonian texts"
"hammarström looks to etruscan, comparing prθni ""lord"", an etruscan honorific loaned into greek as πρύτανις"
"this would make the theonym in origin an honorific, ""the lady"""
"most scholars reject this etymology as implausible, especially since aphrodite actually appears in etruscan in the borrowed form apru"
"the medieval etymologicum magnum  offers a highly contrived etymology, deriving aphrodite from the compound habrodíaitos , ""she who lives delicately"", from habrós and díaita"
"the alteration from b to ph is explained as a ""familiar"" characteristic of greek ""obvious from the macedonians"""
"in the cypriot syllabary, a syllabic script used on the island of cyprus from the eleventh until the fourth century bc, her name is attested in the forms 𐠀𐠡𐠦𐠭𐠃𐠂 , 𐠀𐠡𐠦𐠯𐠭𐠂 , and finally 𐠀𐠡𐠦𐠯𐠪𐠈"
"the cult of aphrodite in greece was imported from, or at least influenced by, the cult of astarte in phoenicia, which, in turn, was influenced by the cult of the mesopotamian goddess known as ""ishtar"" to the east semitic peoples and as ""inanna"" to the sumerians"
"pausanias states that the first to establish a cult of aphrodite were the assyrians, followed by the paphians of cyprus and then the phoenicians at ascalon"
"the phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of cythera.aphrodite took on inanna-ishtar's associations with sexuality and procreation"
"furthermore, she was known as ourania , which means ""heavenly"", a title corresponding to inanna's role as the queen of heaven"
early artistic and literary portrayals of aphrodite are extremely similar on inanna-ishtar
"like inanna-ishtar, aphrodite was also a warrior goddess; the second-century ad greek geographer pausanias records that, in sparta, aphrodite was worshipped as aphrodite areia, which means ""warlike"""
he also mentions that aphrodite's most ancient cult statues in sparta and on cythera showed her bearing arms
modern scholars note that aphrodite's warrior-goddess aspects appear in the oldest strata of her worship and see it as an indication of her near eastern origins
"nineteenth century classical scholars had a general aversion to the idea that ancient greek religion was at all influenced by the cultures of the near east, but, even friedrich gottlieb welcker, who argued that near eastern influence on greek culture was largely confined to material culture, admitted that aphrodite was clearly of phoenician origin"
"the significant influence of near eastern culture on early greek religion in general, and on the cult of aphrodite in particular, is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eighth century bc, when archaic greece was on the fringes of the neo-assyrian empire"
some early comparative mythologists opposed to the idea of a near eastern origin argued that aphrodite originated as an aspect of the greek dawn goddess eos and that she was therefore ultimately derived from the proto-indo-european dawn goddess *haéusōs
"most modern scholars have now rejected the notion of a purely indo-european aphrodite, but it is possible that aphrodite, originally a semitic deity, may have been influenced by the indo-european dawn goddess"
both aphrodite and eos were known for their erotic beauty and aggressive sexuality and both had relationships with mortal lovers
"both goddesses were associated with the colors red, white, and gold"
"michael janda etymologizes aphrodite's name as an epithet of eos meaning ""she who rises from the foam  inspired love for orpheus in the women of thrace, causing them to tear him apart as each of them sought orpheus for herself"
aphrodite personally witnessed the young huntress rhodopis swear eternal devotion and chastity to artemis when she joined her group
"aphrodite then summoned her son eros, and convinced him that such lifestyle was an insult to them both"
"so under her command, eros made rhodopis and euthynicus, another young hunter who had shunned love and romance just like her, to fall in love with each other"
"despite their chaste life, rhodopis and euthynicus withdrew to some cavern where they violated their vows"
"artemis was not slow to take notice after seeing aphrodite laugh, so she changed rhodopis into a fountain as a punishment"
"the myth of the judgement of paris is mentioned briefly in the iliad, but is described in depth in an epitome of the cypria, a lost poem of the epic cycle, which records that all the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of peleus and thetis"
"only eris, goddess of discord, was not invited"
"she was annoyed at this, so she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word καλλίστῃ , which she threw among the goddesses"
"aphrodite, hera, and athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple"
"the goddesses chose to place the matter before zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of paris, a trojan prince"
"after bathing in the spring of mount ida where troy was situated, the goddesses appeared before paris for his decision"
"in the extant ancient depictions of the judgement of paris, aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and athena and hera are always fully clothed"
"since the renaissance, however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked"
"all three goddesses were ideally beautiful and paris could not decide between them, so they resorted to bribes"
"hera tried to bribe paris with power over all asia and europe, and athena offered wisdom, fame and glory in battle, but aphrodite promised paris that, if he were to choose her as the fairest, she would let him marry the most beautiful woman on earth"
"this woman was helen, who was already married to king menelaus of sparta. paris selected aphrodite and awarded her the apple"
"the other two goddesses were enraged and, as a direct result, sided with the greeks in the trojan war"
aphrodite plays an important and active role throughout the entirety of homer's iliad
"in book iii, she rescues paris from menelaus after he foolishly challenges him to a one-on-one duel"
"she then appears to helen in the form of an old woman and attempts to persuade her to have sex with paris, reminding her of his physical beauty and athletic prowess"
"helen immediately recognizes aphrodite by her beautiful neck, perfect breasts, and flashing eyes and chides the goddess, addressing her as her equal"
"aphrodite sharply rebukes helen, reminding her that, if she vexes her, she will punish her just as much as she has favored her already"
"helen demurely obeys aphrodite's command.in book v, aphrodite charges into battle to rescue her son aeneas from the greek hero diomedes"
"diomedes recognizes aphrodite as a ""weakling"" goddess and, thrusting his spear, nicks her wrist through her ""ambrosial robe"""
aphrodite borrows ares's chariot to ride back to mount olympus
"zeus chides her for putting herself in danger, reminding her that ""her specialty is love, not war"
""" according to walter burkert, this scene directly parallels a scene from tablet vi of the epic of gilgamesh in which ishtar, aphrodite's akkadian precursor, cries to her mother antu after the hero gilgamesh rejects her sexual advances, but is mildly rebuked by her father anu"
"in book xiv of the iliad, during the dios apate episode, aphrodite lends her kestos himas to hera for the purpose of seducing zeus and distracting him from the combat while poseidon aids the greek forces on the beach"
"in the theomachia in book xxi, aphrodite again enters the battlefield to carry ares away after he is wounded"
"sometimes poets and dramatists recounted ancient traditions, which varied, and sometimes they invented new details; later scholiasts might draw on either or simply guess"
"thus while aeneas and phobos were regularly described as offspring of aphrodite, others listed here such as priapus and eros were sometimes said to be children of aphrodite but with varying fathers and sometimes given other mothers or none at all"
"aphrodite's most prominent avian symbol was the dove, which was originally an important symbol of her near eastern precursor inanna-ishtar"
aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient greek pottery and the temple of aphrodite pandemos on the southwest slope of the athenian acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks
"votive offerings of small, white, marble doves were also discovered in the temple of aphrodite at daphni"
"in addition to her associations with doves, aphrodite was also closely linked with sparrows and she is described riding in a chariot pulled by sparrows in sappho's ""ode to aphrodite"""
"according to myth, the dove was originally a nymph named peristera who helped aphrodite win in a flower-picking contest over her son eros; for this eros turned her into a dove, but aphrodite took the dove under her wing and made it her sacred bird"
"because of her connections to the sea, aphrodite was associated with a number of different types of water fowl, including swans, geese, and ducks"
"aphrodite's other symbols included the sea, conch shells, and roses. the rose and myrtle flowers were both sacred to aphrodite"
"a myth explaining the origin of aphrodite's connection to myrtle goes that originally the myrtle was a maiden, myrina, a dedicated priestess of aphrodite"
"when her previous betrothed carried her away from the temple to marry her, myrina killed him, and aphrodite turned her into a myrtle, forever under her protection"
"her most important fruit emblem was the apple, and in myth, she turned melus, childhood friend and kin-in-law to adonis, into an apple after he killed himself, mourning over adonis' death"
"likewise, melus's wife pelia was turned into a dove"
"she was also associated with pomegranates, possibly because the red seeds suggested sexuality or because greek women sometimes used pomegranates as a method of birth control"
"in greek art, aphrodite is often also accompanied by dolphins and nereids"
"a scene of aphrodite rising from the sea appears on the back of the ludovisi throne , which was probably originally part of a massive altar that was constructed as part of the ionic temple to aphrodite in the greek polis of locri epizephyrii in magna graecia in southern italy"
"the throne shows aphrodite rising from the sea, clad in a diaphanous garment, which is drenched with seawater and clinging to her body, revealing her upturned breasts and the outline of her navel"
"her hair hangs dripping as she reaches to two attendants standing barefoot on the rocky shore on either side of her, lifting her out of the water"
"scenes with aphrodite appear in works of classical greek pottery, including a famous white-ground kylix by the pistoxenos painter dating the between c"
"470 and 460 bc, showing her riding on a swan or goose. aphrodite was often described as golden-haired and portrayed with this color hair in art.in c"
"364/361 bc, the athenian sculptor praxiteles carved the marble statue aphrodite of knidos, which pliny the elder later praised as the greatest sculpture ever made"
the statue showed a nude aphrodite modestly covering her pubic region while resting against a water pot with her robe draped over it for support
the aphrodite of knidos was the first full-sized statue to depict aphrodite completely naked and one of the first sculptures that was intended to be viewed from all sides
the statue was purchased by the people of knidos in around 350 bc and proved to be tremendously influential on later depictions of aphrodite
"the original sculpture has been lost, but written descriptions of it as well several depictions of it on coins are still extant and over sixty copies, small-scale models, and fragments of it have been identified"
"the greek painter apelles of kos, a contemporary of praxiteles, produced the panel painting aphrodite anadyomene"
"according to athenaeus, apelles was inspired to paint the painting after watching the courtesan phryne take off her clothes, untie her hair, and bathe naked in the sea at eleusis"
the painting was displayed in the asclepeion on the island of kos
"the aphrodite anadyomene went unnoticed for centuries, but pliny the elder records that, in his own time, it was regarded as apelles's most famous work"
"during the hellenistic and roman periods, statues depicting aphrodite proliferated; many of these statues were modeled at least to some extent on praxiteles's aphrodite of knidos"
some statues show aphrodite crouching naked; others show her wringing water out of her hair as she rises from the sea
"another common type of statue is known as aphrodite kallipygos, the name of which is greek for ""aphrodite of the beautiful buttocks""; this type of sculpture shows aphrodite lifting her peplos to display her buttocks to the viewer while looking back at them from over her shoulder"
the ancient romans produced massive numbers of copies of greek sculptures of aphrodite and more sculptures of aphrodite have survived from antiquity than of any other deity
early christians frequently adapted pagan iconography to suit christian purposes
"in the early middle ages, christians adapted elements of aphrodite/venus's iconography and applied them to eve and prostitutes, but also female saints and even the virgin mary"
"christians in the east reinterpreted the story of aphrodite's birth as a metaphor for baptism; in a coptic stele from the sixth century ad, a female orant is shown wearing aphrodite's conch shell as a sign that she is newly baptized"
"throughout the middle ages, villages and communities across europe still maintained folk tales and traditions about aphrodite/venus and travelers reported a wide variety of stories"
"numerous roman mosaics of venus survived in britain, preserving memory of the pagan past"
"in north africa in the late fifth century ad, fulgentius of ruspe encountered mosaics of aphrodite and reinterpreted her as a symbol of the sin of lust, arguing that she was shown naked because ""the sin of lust is never cloaked"" and that she was often shown ""swimming"" because ""all lust suffers shipwreck of its affairs"
""" he also argued that she was associated with doves and conchs because these are symbols of copulation, and that she was associated with roses because ""as the rose gives pleasure, but is swept away by the swift movement of the seasons, so lust is pleasant for a moment, but is swept away forever"
"""while fulgentius had appropriated aphrodite as a symbol of lust, isidore of seville  interpreted her as a symbol of marital procreative sex and declared that the moral of the story of aphrodite's birth is that sex can only be holy in the presence of semen, blood, and heat, which he regarded as all being necessary for procreation"
"meanwhile, isidore denigrated aphrodite/venus's son eros/cupid as a ""demon of fornication"""
aphrodite/venus was best known to western european scholars through her appearances in virgil's aeneid and ovid's metamorphoses
"venus is mentioned in the latin poem pervigilium veneris , written in the third or fourth century ad, and in giovanni boccaccio's genealogia deorum gentilium"
since the late middle ages
"the myth of the venusberg  – a subterranean realm ruled by venus, hidden underneath christian europe – became a motif of european folklore rendered in various legends and epics"
"in german folklore of the 16th century, the narrative becomes associated with the minnesinger tannhäuser, and in that form the myth was taken up in later literature and opera"
"aphrodite is the central figure in sandro botticelli's painting primavera, which has been described as ""one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world"", and ""one of the most popular paintings in western art"""
"the story of aphrodite's birth from the foam was a popular subject matter for painters during the italian renaissance, who were attempting to consciously reconstruct apelles of kos's lost masterpiece aphrodite anadyomene based on the literary ekphrasis of it preserved by cicero and pliny the elder"
artists also drew inspiration from ovid's description of the birth of venus in his metamorphoses
sandro botticelli's the birth of venus  was also partially inspired by a description by poliziano of a relief on the subject
later italian renditions of the same scene include titian's venus anadyomene  and raphael's painting in the stufetta del cardinal bibbiena
"titian's biographer giorgio vasari identified all of titian's paintings of naked women as paintings of ""venus"", including an erotic painting from c"
"1534, which he called the venus of urbino, even though the painting does not contain any of aphrodite/venus's traditional iconography and the woman in it is clearly shown in a contemporary setting, not a classical one"
"the birth of venus  by alexandre cabaneljacques-louis david's final work was his 1824 magnum opus, mars being disarmed by venus, which combines elements of classical, renaissance, traditional french art, and contemporary artistic styles"
"while he was working on the painting, david described it, saying, ""this is the last picture i want to paint, but i want to surpass myself in it"
i will put the date of my seventy-five years on it and afterwards i will never again pick up my brush
""" the painting was exhibited first in brussels and then in paris, where over 10,000 people came to see it"
jean-auguste-dominique ingres's painting venus anadyomene was one of his major works
"louis geofroy described it as a ""dream of youth realized with the power of maturity, a happiness that few obtain, artists or others"

""" other critics dismissed it as a piece of unimaginative, sentimental kitsch, but ingres himself considered it to be among his greatest works and used the same figure as the model for his later 1856 painting la source"
paintings of venus were favorites of the late nineteenth-century academic artists in france
"in 1863, alexandre cabanel won widespread critical acclaim at the paris salon for his painting the birth of venus, which the french emperor napoleon iii immediately purchased for his own personal art collection"
"édouard manet's 1865 painting olympia parodied the nude venuses of the academic painters, particularly cabanel's birth of venus"
"in 1867, the english academic painter frederic leighton displayed his venus disrobing for the bath at the academy. the art critic j. b"
"atkinson praised it, declaring that ""mr leighton, instead of adopting corrupt roman notions regarding venus such as rubens embodied, has wisely reverted to the greek idea of aphrodite, a goddess worshipped, and by artists painted, as the perfection of female grace and beauty"
""" a year later, the english painter dante gabriel rossetti, a founding member of the pre-raphaelite brotherhood, painted venus verticordia , showing aphrodite as a nude red-headed woman in a garden of roses"
"though he was reproached for his outré subject matter, rossetti refused to alter the painting and it was soon purchased by j. mitchell of bradford"
"in 1879, william adolphe bouguereau exhibited at the paris salon his own birth of venus, which imitated the classical tradition of contrapposto and was met with widespread critical acclaim, rivalling the popularity of cabanel's version from nearly two decades prior"
"william shakespeare's erotic narrative poem venus and adonis , a retelling of the courtship of aphrodite and adonis from ovid's metamorphoses, was the most popular of all his works published within his own lifetime"
six editions of it were published before shakespeare's death  and it enjoyed particularly strong popularity among young adults
"in 1605, richard barnfield lauded it, declaring that the poem had placed shakespeare's name ""in fames immortall booke"""
"despite this, the poem has received mixed reception from modern critics; samuel taylor coleridge defended it, but samuel butler complained that it bored him and c"
"s. lewis described an attempted reading of it as ""suffocating"""
"aphrodite appears in richard garnett's short story collection the twilight of the gods and other tales , in which the gods' temples have been destroyed by christians"
stories revolving around sculptures of aphrodite were common in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
"examples of such works of literature include the novel the tinted venus: a farcical romance  by thomas anstey guthrie and the short story the venus of ille  by prosper mérimée, both of which are about statues of aphrodite that come to life"
"another noteworthy example is aphrodite in aulis by the anglo-irish writer george moore, which revolves around an ancient greek family who moves to aulis"
the french writer pierre louÿs titled his erotic historical novel aphrodite: mœurs antiques  after the greek goddess
"the novel enjoyed widespread commercial success, but scandalized french audiences due to its sensuality and its decadent portrayal of greek society"
"in the early twentieth century, stories of aphrodite were used by feminist poets, such as amy lowell and alicia ostriker"
many of these poems dealt with aphrodite's legendary birth from the foam of the sea
"other feminist writers, including claude cahun, thit jensen, and anaïs nin also made use of the myth of aphrodite in their writings"
"ever since the publication of isabel allende's book aphrodite: a memoir of the senses in 1998, the name ""aphrodite"" has been used as a title for dozens of books dealing with all topics even superficially connected to her domain"
"frequently these books do not even mention aphrodite, or mention her only briefly, but make use of her name as a selling point"
"in 1938, gleb botkin, a russian immigrant to the united states, founded the church of aphrodite, a neopagan religion centered around the worship of a mother goddess, whom its practitioners identified as aphrodite"
"the church of aphrodite's theology was laid out in the book in search of reality, published in 1969, two years before botkin's death"
"the book portrayed aphrodite in a drastically different light than the one in which the greeks envisioned her, instead casting her as ""the sole goddess of a somewhat neoplatonic pagan monotheism"""
"it claimed that the worship of aphrodite had been brought to greece by the mystic teacher orpheus, but that the greeks had misunderstood orpheus's teachings and had not realized the importance of worshipping aphrodite alone"
"aphrodite is a major deity in wicca, a contemporary nature-based syncretic neopagan religion"
wiccans regard aphrodite as one aspect of the goddess and she is frequently invoked by name during enchantments dealing with love and romance
"mortar is a workable paste which hardens to bind building blocks such as stones, bricks, and concrete masonry units, to fill and seal the irregular gaps between them, spread the weight of them evenly, and sometimes to add decorative colors or patterns to masonry walls"
"in its broadest sense, mortar includes pitch, asphalt, and soft mud or clay, as those used between mud bricks, as well as cement mortar"
"the word ""mortar"" comes from old french mortier, ""builder's mortar, plaster; bowl for mixing."""
"cement mortar becomes hard when it cures, resulting in a rigid aggregate structure; however, the mortar functions as a weaker component than the building blocks and serves as the sacrificial element in the masonry, because mortar is easier and less expensive to repair than the building blocks"
"bricklayers typically make mortars using a mixture of sand, a binder, and water"
"the most common binder since the early 20th century is portland cement, but the ancient binder lime mortar is still used in some specialty new construction"
"lime, lime mortar, and gypsum in the form of plaster of paris are used particularly in the repair and repointing of historic buildings and structures, so that the repair materials will be similar in performance and appearance to the original materials"
several types of cement mortars and additives exist
"the first mortars were made of mud and clay, as demonstrated in the 10th millennia bce buildings of jericho, and the 8th millennia bce of ganj dareh"
"according to roman ghirshman, the first evidence of humans using a form of mortar was at the mehrgarh of baluchistan in what is today pakistan, built of sun-dried bricks in 6500 bce"
"gypsum mortar, also called plaster of paris, was used in the construction of many ancient structures"
"it is made from gypsum, which requires a lower firing temperature"
"it is therefore easier to make than lime mortar and sets up much faster, which may be a reason it was used as the typical mortar in ancient, brick arch and vault construction"
gypsum mortar is not as durable as other mortars in damp conditions
"in the indian subcontinent, multiple cement types have been observed in the sites of the indus valley civilization, with gypsum appearing at sites such as the mohenjo-daro city-settlement, which dates to earlier than 2600 bce"
"gypsum cement that was ""light grey and contained sand, clay, traces of calcium carbonate, and a high percentage of lime"" was used in the construction of wells, drains, and on the exteriors of ""important looking buildings"
""" bitumen mortar was also used at a lower-frequency, including in the great bath at mohenjo-daro"
"in early egyptian pyramids, which were constructed during the old kingdom , the limestone blocks were bound by a mortar of mud and clay, or clay and sand"
"in later egyptian pyramids, the mortar was made of gypsum, or lime. gypsum mortar was essentially a mixture of plaster and sand and was quite soft"
"2nd millennia bce babylonian constructions used lime or pitch for mortar. historically, building with concrete and mortar next appeared in greece"
the excavation of the underground aqueduct of megara revealed that a reservoir was coated with a pozzolanic mortar 12 mm thick
this aqueduct dates back to c. 500 bce
"pozzolanic mortar is a lime based mortar, but is made with an additive of volcanic ash that allows it to be hardened underwater; thus it is known as hydraulic cement"
"the greeks obtained the volcanic ash from the greek islands thira and nisiros, or from the then greek colony of dicaearchia  near naples, italy"
the romans later improved the use and methods of making what became known as pozzolanic mortar and cement
"even later, the romans used a mortar without pozzolana using crushed terra cotta, introducing aluminum oxide and silicon dioxide into the mix"
"this mortar was not as strong as pozzolanic mortar, but, because it was denser, it better resisted penetration by water"
"hydraulic mortar was not available in ancient china, possibly due to a lack of volcanic ash"
"around 500 ce, sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to make an inorganic−organic composite sticky rice mortar that had more strength and water resistance than lime mortar"
"it is not understood how the art of making hydraulic mortar and cement, which was perfected and in such widespread use by both the greeks and romans, was then lost for almost two millennia"
"during the middle ages when the gothic cathedrals were being built, the only active ingredient in the mortar was lime"
"since cured lime mortar can be degraded by contact with water, many structures suffered over the centuries from wind-blown rain"
"ordinary portland cement mortar, commonly known as opc mortar or just cement mortar, is created by mixing powdered ordinary portland cement, fine aggregate and water"
"it was invented in 1794 by joseph aspdin and patented on 18 december 1824, largely as a result of efforts to develop stronger mortars"
"it was made popular during the late nineteenth century, and had by 1930 became more popular than lime mortar as construction material"
"the advantages of portland cement is that it sets hard and quickly, allowing a faster pace of construction"
"furthermore, fewer skilled workers are required in building a structure with portland cement"
"as a general rule, however, portland cement should not be used for the repair or repointing of older buildings built in lime mortar, which require the flexibility, softness and breathability of lime if they are to function correctly"
"in the united states and other countries, five standard types of mortar  are generally used for both new construction and repair"
"strengths of mortar change based on the mix ratio for each type of mortar, which are specified under the astm standards"
"these premixed mortar products are designated by one of the five letters, m, s, n, o, and k. type m mortar is the strongest, and type k the weakest"
the mix ratio is always expressed by volume of portland cement : lime : sand {\displaystyle {\text{portland cement : lime : sand}}}
"these type letters are apparently taken from the alternate letters of the words ""mason work"""
polymer cement mortars  are the materials which are made by partially replacing the cement hydrate binders of conventional cement mortar with polymers
"the polymeric admixtures include latexes or emulsions, redispersible polymer powders, water-soluble polymers, liquid thermoset resins and monomers"
"although they increase cost of mortars when used as an additive, they enhance properties"
"polymer mortar has low permeability that may be detrimental to moisture accumulation when used to repair a traditional brick, block or stone wall"
it is mainly designed for repairing concrete structures. the use of recovered plastics in mortars is being researched and is gaining ground
depolymerizing pet to use as a polymeric binder to enhance mortars is actively being studied
"the setting speed can be increased by using impure limestone in the kiln, to form a hydraulic lime that will set on contact with water"
"such a lime must be stored as a dry powder. alternatively, a pozzolanic material such as calcined clay or brick dust may be added to the mortar mix"
addition of a pozzolanic material will make the mortar set reasonably quickly by reaction with the water
it would be problematic to use portland cement mortars to repair older buildings originally constructed using lime mortar
"lime mortar is softer than cement mortar, allowing brickwork a certain degree of flexibility to adapt to shifting ground or other changing conditions"
cement mortar is harder and allows little flexibility. the contrast can cause brickwork to crack where the two mortars are present in a single wall
lime mortar is considered breathable in that it will allow moisture to freely move through and evaporate from the surface
"in old buildings with walls that shift over time, cracks can be found which allow rain water into the structure"
the lime mortar allows this moisture to escape through evaporation and keeps the wall dry
re−pointing or rendering an old wall with cement mortar stops the evaporation and can cause problems associated with moisture behind the cement
"pozzolana is a fine, sandy volcanic ash"
"it was originally discovered and dug at pozzuoli, nearby mount vesuvius in italy, and was subsequently mined at other sites, too"
the romans learned that pozzolana added to lime mortar allowed the lime to set relatively quickly and even under water
"vitruvius, the roman architect, spoke of four types of pozzolana"
"it is found in all the volcanic areas of italy in various colours: black, white, grey and red"
pozzolana has since become a generic term for any siliceous and/or aluminous additive to slaked lime to create hydraulic cement
"finely ground and mixed with lime it is a hydraulic cement, like portland cement, and makes a strong mortar that will also set under water"
"as the mortar hardens, the current atmosphere is encased in the mortar and thus provides a sample for analysis"
various factors affect the sample and raise the margin of error for the analysis
"radiocarbon dating of mortar began as early as the 1960s, soon after the method was established"
tthe doric order was one of the three orders of ancient greek and later roman architecture; the other two canonical orders were the ionic and the corinthian
the doric is most easily recognized by the simple circular capitals at the top of columns
"the greek doric column was fluted or smooth-surfaced and had no base, dropping straight into the stylobate or platform on which the temple or other building stood"
"in their original greek version, doric columns stood directly on the flat pavement (the stylobate) of a temple without a base"
there are many theories as to the origins of the doric order in temples
the term doric is believed to have originated from the greek-speaking dorian tribes
"ancient greek cuisine was characterized by its frugality for most, reflecting agricultural hardship, but a great diversity of ingredients was known, and wealthy greeks were known to celebrate with elaborate meals and feasts"
": 95 the cuisine was founded on the ""mediterranean triad"" of cereals, olives, and grapes, which had many uses and great commercial value, but other ingredients were as important, if not more so, to the average diet: most notably legumes"
research suggests that the agricultural system of ancient greece could not have succeeded without the cultivation of legumes
"modern knowledge of ancient greek cuisine and eating habits is derived from textual, archeological, and artistic evidence"
"in the homeric epics of iliad and odyssey, three meals are mentioned"
"ariston  dorpon  or dorpos  deipnon ariston was the early meal, while dorpon was the late meal. deipnon could be either, without reference to time"
"in the later age greeks had the below meals: acratisma  ariston deipnonacratisma was the early meal , ariston was the middle meal and deipnon was the evening meal"
"breakfast breakfast  consisted of barley bread dipped in wine , sometimes complemented by figs, dates or olives"
"they also ate a sort of pancake called τηγανίτης , ταγηνίτης  or ταγηνίας , all words deriving from τάγηνον , ""frying pan"""
the earliest attested references on tagenias are in the works of the 5th century bc poets cratinus and magnes
"tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast"
"another kind of pancake was σταιτίτης , from σταίτινος , ""of flour or dough of spelt"", derived from σταῖς , ""flour of spelt"""
"athenaeus in his deipnosophistae mentions staititas topped with honey, sesame and cheese"
"lunch a quick lunch  was taken around noon or early afternoon. dinner dinner , the most important meal of the day, was generally taken at nightfall"
an additional light meal  was sometimes taken in the late afternoon
"ἀριστόδειπνον / aristódeipnon, literally ""lunch-dinner"", was served in the late afternoon instead of dinner.epideipnis  was a second course at dinner"
epideipnis  was a second course at dinner. eating customs men and women took their meals separately
"when the house was small, the men ate first and the women afterwards. respect for the father who was the breadwinner was obvious"
"slaves waited at dinners. aristotle notes that ""the poor, having no slaves, would ask their wives or children to serve food"
""" the ancient greek custom of placing terracotta miniatures of furniture in children's graves gives a good idea of its style and design"
the greeks normally ate while seated on chairs; benches were used for banquets
"tables - high for normal meals, low for banquets - were initially rectangular"
"by the 4th century bc, most tables were round, often with animal-shaped legs"
loaves of flat bread were occasionally used as plates; terracotta bowls were more common
"dishes became more refined over time, and by the roman period plates were sometimes made out of precious metals or glass"
cutlery was not often used at the table. use of the fork was unknown; people ate with their fingers. knives were used to cut the meat
knives were used to cut the meat. spoons were used for soups and broths
spoons were used for soups and broths. pieces of bread  could be used to spoon the food or as napkins to wipe the fingers
"as with modern dinner parties, the host could simply invite friends or family; but two other forms of social dining were well documented in ancient greece: the entertainment of the all-male symposium, and the obligatory, regimental syssitia"
"symposium the symposium , traditionally translated as ""banquet"", but more literally ""gathering of drinkers"", was one of the preferred pastimes for greek men"
"it consisted of two parts: the first dedicated to food, generally rather simple, and a second part dedicated to drinking"
"however, wine was consumed with the food, and the beverages were accompanied by snacks  such as chestnuts, beans, toasted wheat, or honey cakes, all intended to absorb alcohol and extend the drinking spree"
"the second part was inaugurated with a libation, most often in honor of dionysus, followed by conversation or table games, such as kottabos"
the guests would recline on couches ; low tables held the food or game boards
"dancers, acrobats, and musicians would entertain the wealthy banqueters"
"a ""king of the banquet"" was drawn by lots; he had to direct the slaves as to how strong to mix the wine"
"with the exception of courtesans, the banquet was strictly reserved for men. it was an essential element of greek social life"
"great feasts could only be afforded by the rich; in most greek homes, religious feasts or family events were the occasion of more modest banquets"
"the banquet became the setting of a specific genre of literature, giving birth to plato's symposium, xenophon's work of the same name, the table talk of plutarch's moralia, and the deipnosophists  of athenaeus"
"syssitia the syssitia  were mandatory meals shared by social or religious groups for men and youths, especially in crete and sparta"
"they were referred to variously as hetairia, pheiditia, or andreia . they served as both a kind of aristocratic club and as a military mess"
"like the symposium, the syssitia was the exclusive domain of men – although some references have been found to substantiate all-female syssitia"
"unlike the symposium, these meals were hallmarked by simplicity and temperance"
"first she set for them a fair and well made table that had feet of cyanus; on it there was a vessel of bronze and an onion to give relish to the drink, with honey and cakes of barley meal"
breads and cakes cereals formed the staple diet. the two main grains were wheat  and barley
the two main grains were wheat  and barley .when greece was conquered by rome during the 3rd century b.c
"c., commercial bakeries were well known and spread"
in fact pliny the elder suggests that the production of bread moved from the family to the “industrial” thanks to the work of skilled artisans
"plato favored home production over commercial production and in gorgias, described thearion the baker as an athenian novelty who sells goods that could be made at home"
"in ancient greece, bread was served with accompaniments known as opson ὄψον, sometimes rendered in english as ""relish"""
"this was a generic term which referred to anything which accompanied this staple food, whether meat or fish, fruit or vegetable"
cakes may have been consumed for religious reasons as well as secular
"philoxenus of cythera describes in detail some cakes that were eaten as part of an elaborate dinner using the traditional dithyrambic style used for sacred dionysian hymns: ""mixed with safflower, toasted, wheat-oat-white-chickpea-little thistle-little-sesame-honey-mouthful of everything, with a honey rim"""
"athenaeus says the charisios was eaten at the ""all-night festival"", but john wilkins notes that the distinction between the sacred and secular can be blurred in antiquity"
"ancient writers mention melitoutta , which was a honeycake"
"wheat wheat grains were softened by soaking, then either reduced into gruel, or ground into flour  and kneaded and formed into loaves  or flatbreads, either plain or mixed with cheese or honey"
leavening was known; the greeks later used an alkali  and wine yeast as leavening agents. dough loaves were baked at home in a clay oven  set on legs
"bread wheat, difficult to grow in mediterranean climates, and the white bread made from it, were associated with the upper classes in the ancient mediterranean, while the poor ate coarse brown breads made from emmer wheat and barley"
"a simpler baking method involved placing lighted coals on the floor and covering the heap with a dome-shaped lid ; when it was hot enough, the coals were swept aside, and dough loaves were placed on the warm floor"
"the lid was then put back in place, and the coals were gathered on the side of the cover.the stone oven did not appear until the roman period"
"solon, an athenian lawmaker of the 6th century bc, prescribed that leavened bread be reserved for feast days"
"by the end of the 5th century bc, leavened bread was sold at the market, though it was expensive"
"barley barley was easier to grow than wheat, but more difficult to make bread from. barley-based breads were nourishing but very heavy"
"because of this, it was often roasted before being milled into coarse flour . barley flour was used to make μᾶζα maza, the basic greek dish"
"maza could be served cooked or raw, as a broth, or made into dumplings or flatbreads"
"like wheat breads, it could also be augmented with cheese or honey"
"in peace, aristophanes employs the expression ἐσθίειν κριθὰς μόνας, literally ""to eat only barley"", with a meaning equivalent to the english ""diet of bread and water"""
"millet millet was growing wild in greece as early as 3000 bce, and bulk storage containers for millet have been found from the late bronze age in macedonia and northern greece"
"hesiod describes that ""the beards grow round the millet, which men sow in summer"
"""millet is listed along with wheat in the 3rd century bce by theophrastus in his ""enquiry into plants"" emmer black bread, made from emmer , was cheaper  than wheat; it was associated with the lower classes and the poor"
"legumes were essential to the greek diet, and were harvested in the mediterranean region from prehistoric times: the earliest and most common being lentils - which have been found in archeological sites in greece dating to the upper paleolithic period"
"as one of the first domesticated crops to be introduced to greece, lentils are commonly found at regional archaeological sites from the upper paleolithic"
lentils and chickpeas are the most frequently mentioned legumes in classical literature
"bitter vetch – this plant was present in greece from at least 8000 bce, and was occasionally eaten in classical times"
most ancient literature that mentions it describes it as animal food and having a disagreeable taste
several classical authors suggest medicinal uses for it
": 378 black beans – homer mentions the threshing a black bean  as a metaphor in the iliad broad beans – broad, or fava beans are rare in archeological sites, but are common in classical literature"
they were eaten both as main dishes and also included in desserts
"in addition to describing them as food, classical authors attribute various medicinal qualities to the beans"
": 380 chickpeas – chickpeas are mentioned almost as frequently in classical literature as lentils , but are found rarely in archeological sites in greece"
"as they are found in prehistoric sites in the middle east and india, it is likely their use was a late addition to the ancient greek diet: 376 grass peas – like bitter vetch, grass peas were grown in ancient greece mainly for animal fodder, however they were occasionally eaten in times of famine : 381 lentils – theophrastus states that ""of the leguminous plants, the lentil is the most prolific"" lupin bean – lupin  beans were present in the mediterranean region from prehistoric times and were cultivated in egypt by at least 2000 bce"
"by classical times, the greeks were using them for both food and animal fodder"
"garden peas – peas are commonly found in some of the earliest archaeological sites in greece, but are rarely mentioned in classical literature"
"however hesiod and theophrastus both include them as food eaten by greeks: 381 in ancient greece, fruit and vegetables were a significant part of the diet, as the ancient greeks consumed much less meat than in the typical diet of modern societies"
"legumes would have been important crops, as their ability to replenish exhausted soil was known at least by the time of xenophon"
"hesiod  describes many crops eaten by the ancient greeks, among these are artichokes and peas"
"vegetables were eaten as soups, boiled or mashed , seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, herbs or γάρον gáron, a fish sauce similar to vietnamese nước mắm"
"in the comedies of aristophanes, heracles was portrayed as a glutton with a fondness for mashed beans. poor families ate oak acorns"
poor families ate oak acorns . olives were a common appetizer
"in the cities, fresh vegetables were expensive, and therefore, the poorer city dwellers had to make do with dried vegetables"
"lentil soup  was the workman's typical dish. cheese, garlic, and onions were the soldier's traditional fare"
"in aristophanes' peace, the smell of onions typically represents soldiers; the chorus, celebrating the end of war, sings oh! joy, joy! no more helmet, no more cheese nor onions! bitter vetch  was considered a famine food"
"fruits, fresh or dried, and nuts, were eaten as dessert. important fruits were figs, raisins, dates and pomegranates"
"in athenaeus' deipnosophistae, he describes a dessert made of figs and broad beans. dried figs were also eaten as an appetizer or when drinking wine"
"in the latter case, they were often accompanied by grilled chestnuts, chick peas, and beechnuts"
"meat in the 8th century bc hesiod describes the ideal country feast in works and days: but at that time let me have a shady rock and bibline wine, a clot of curds and milk of drained goats with the flesh of a heifer fed in the woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids; then also let me drink bright wine… meat is much less prominent in texts of the 5th century bc onwards than in the earliest poetry, but this may be a matter of genre rather than real evidence of changes in farming and food customs"
"fresh meat was most commonly eaten at sacrifices, though sausage was much more common, consumed by people across the economic spectrum"
"in addition to the flesh of animals, the ancient greeks often ate inner organs, many of which were considered delicacies such as paunches and tripe"
"but above all i do delight in dishes of paunches and of tripe from gelded beasts, and love a fragrant pig within the oven"
"hippolochus  describes a wedding banquet in macedonia with ""chickens and ducks, and ringdoves, too, and a goose, and an abundance of suchlike viands piled high"
.
". following which came a second platter of silver, on which again lay a huge loaf, and geese, hares, young goats, and curiously moulded cakes besides, pigeons, turtle-doves, partridges, and other fowl in plenty"
".."" and ""a roast pig — a big one, too — which lay on its back upon it; the belly, seen from above, disclosed that it was full of many bounties"
"for, roasted inside it, were thrushes, ducks, and warblers in unlimited number, pease purée poured over eggs, oysters, and scallops"": 95 spartans primarily ate a soup made from pigs' legs and blood, known as melas zōmos , which means ""black soup"""
"according to plutarch, it was ""so much valued that the elderly men fed only upon that, leaving what flesh there was to the younger"""
it was famous amongst the greeks
"""naturally spartans are the bravest men in the world,"" joked a sybarite, ""anyone in his senses would rather die ten thousand times than take his share of such a sorry diet"""
"it was made with pork, salt, vinegar and blood. the dish was served with maza, figs and cheese sometimes supplemented with game and fish"
the 2nd–3rd century author aelian claims that spartan cooks were prohibited from cooking anything other than meat
"the consumption of fish and meat varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household; in the country, hunting  allowed for consumption of birds and hares"
"peasants also had farmyards to provide them with chickens and geese. slightly wealthier landowners could raise goats, pigs, or sheep"
"in the city, meat was expensive except for pork. in aristophanes' day a piglet cost three drachmas, which was three days' wages for a public servant"
sausages were common both for the poor and the rich
"archaeological excavations at kavousi kastro, lerna, and kastanas have shown that dogs were sometimes consumed in bronze age greece, in addition to the more commonly-consumed pigs, cattle, sheep, and goats"
"fish herodotus describes a ""large fish.."
".. of the sort called antacaei, without any prickly bones, and good for pickling,"" probably beluga found in greek colonies along the dnieper river"
"other ancient writers mention skipjack tuna ; tuna ; swordfish ; sea raven ; black carp , porpoise , and mackerel"
"in the greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood  were common. they were eaten locally but more often transported inland"
"sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of athens. they were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted"
"a stele of the late 3rd century bc from the small boeotian city of akraiphia, on lake copais, provides us with a list of fish prices"
the cheapest was skaren  whereas atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive
"common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted"
"lake copais itself was famous in all greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of the acharnians"
"other fresh water fish were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish"
"in classical athens, eels, conger-eels, and sea-perch  were considered to be great delicacies, while sprats were cheap and readily available"
fowl ancient greeks consumed a much wider variety of birds than is typical today. pheasants were present as early as 2000 bce
"domestic chickens were brought to greece from asia minor as early as 600 bce, and domesticated geese are described in the odyssey"
"quail, moorhen, capon, mallards, pheasants, larks, pigeons and doves were all domesticated in classical times, and were even for sale in markets"
"additionally, thrush, blackbirds, chaffinch, lark, starling, jay, jackdaw, sparrow, siskin, blackcap, rock partridge, grebe, plover, coot, wagtail, francolin, and even cranes were hunted, or trapped, and eaten, and sometimes available in markets"
": 63 eggs greeks bred quails and hens, partly for their eggs"
"some authors also praise pheasant eggs and egyptian goose eggs, which were presumably rather rare"
eggs were cooked soft- or hard-boiled as hors d'œuvre or dessert
"whites, yolks and whole eggs were also used as ingredients in the preparation of dishes"
"milk hesiod describes ""milk cake, and milk of goats drained dry"" in his works and days"
"country dwellers drank milk , but it was seldom used in cooking"
"butter butter  was known but seldom used: greeks saw it as a culinary trait of the thracians of the northern aegean coast, whom the middle comic poet anaxandrides dubbed ""butter eaters"""
"cheese and yogurt cheesemaking was widespread by the 8th century bce, as the technical vocabulary associated with it is included in the odyssey"
": 66 greeks enjoyed other dairy products. πυριατή pyriatē and oxygala  were curdled milk products, similar to cottage cheese or perhaps to yogurt"
"most of all, goat's and ewe's cheese  was a staple food"
fresh cheeses  and hard cheeses were sold in different shops; the former cost about two thirds of the latter's price
"cheese was eaten alone or with honey or vegetables. it was also used as an ingredient in the preparation of many dishes, including fish dishes"
"however, the addition of cheese seems to have been a controversial matter; archestratus warns his readers that syracusan cooks spoil good fish by adding cheese"
the first spice mentioned in ancient greek writings is cassia: sappho  mentions it in her poem on the marriage of hector and andromache
": 44, ln 30 the ancient greeks made a distinction between ceylon cinnamon and cassia"
"ancient greeks used at least two forms of pepper in cooking and medicine: one of aristotle's students, theophrastus, in describing the plants that appeared in greece as a result of alexander's conquest of india and asia minor, listed both black pepper and long pepper, stating ""one is round like bitter vetch"
"..: the other is elongated and black and has seeds like those of a poppy : and this kind is much stronger than the other. both however are heating..."""
".."".theophrastus lists several plants in his book as ""pot herbs"" including dill, coriander, anise, cumin, fennel,: 81 rue,: 27 celery and celery seed"
": 125 homer describes the preparation of a wine and cheese drink: taking ""pramnian wine she grated goat's milk cheese into it with a bronze grater  oil"
"archestratus , the self-titled ""inventor of made dishes,"" describes a recipe for paunch and tripe, cooked in ""cumin juice, and vinegar and sharp, strong-smelling silphium"""
the most widespread drink was water. fetching water was a daily task for women
"though wells were common, spring water was preferred: it was recognized as nutritious because it caused plants and trees to grow, and also as a desirable beverage"
"pindar called spring water ""as agreeable as honey"".the greeks would describe water as robust, heavy or light, dry, acidic, pungent, wine-like, etc"
one of the comic poet antiphanes's characters claimed that he could recognize attic water by taste alone
"athenaeus states that a number of philosophers had a reputation for drinking nothing but water, a habit combined with a vegetarian diet"
"milk, usually goats' milk, was not widely consumed, being considered barbaric"
"the usual drinking vessel was the skyphos, made out of wood, terra cotta, or metal"
"critias also mentions the kothon, a spartan goblet which had the military advantage of hiding the colour of the water from view and trapping mud in its edge"
"the ancient greeks also used a vessel called a kylix , and for banquets the kantharos  or the rhyton, a drinking horn often moulded into the form of a human or animal head"
the greeks are thought to have made red as well as rosé and white wines
"like today, these varied in quality from common table wine to valuable vintages"
"it was generally considered that the best wines came from thásos, lesbos and chios.cretan wine came to prominence later"
"cretan wine came to prominence later. a secondary wine made from water and pomace , mixed with lees, was made by country people for their own use"
"the greeks sometimes sweetened their wine with honey and made medicinal wines by adding thyme, pennyroyal and other herbs"
"by the first century, if not before, they were familiar with wine flavoured with pine resin . aelian also mentions a wine mixed with perfume"
"aelian also mentions a wine mixed with perfume. cooked wine was known, as well as a sweet wine from thásos, similar to port wine"
wine was generally cut with water
"the drinking of akraton or ""unmixed wine"", though known to be practised by northern barbarians, was thought likely to lead to madness and death"
"wine was mixed in a krater, from which the slaves would fill the drinker's kylix with an oinochoe . wine was also thought to have medicinal powers"
"aelian mentions that the wine from heraia in arcadia rendered men foolish but women fertile; conversely, achaean wine was thought to induce abortion"
"outside of these therapeutic uses, greek society did not approve of women drinking wine"
"according to aelian, a massalian law prohibited this and restricted women to drinking water"
sparta was the only city where women routinely drank wine. wine reserved for local use was kept in skins
"wine reserved for local use was kept in skins. that destined for sale was poured into πίθοι pithoi,"
from there they were decanted into amphoras sealed with pitch for retail sale
vintage wines carried stamps from the producers or city magistrates who guaranteed their origin
this is one of the first instances of indicating the geographical or qualitative provenance of a product
"the greeks also drank kykeon , which was both a beverage and a meal. it was a barley gruel, to which water and herbs were added"
"in the iliad, the beverage also contained grated goat cheese. in the odyssey, circe adds honey and a magic potion to it"
"in the homeric hymn to demeter, the goddess refuses red wine but accepts a kykeon made of water, flour, and pennyroyal"
"used as a ritual beverage in the eleusinian mysteries, kykeon was also a popular beverage, especially in the countryside: theophrastus, in his characters, describes a boorish peasant as having drunk much kykeon and inconveniencing the assembly with his bad breath"
"it also had a reputation as a good digestive, and as such, in peace, hermes recommends it to the main character who has eaten too much dried fruit"
timachidas the rhodian wrote 11 books with dinner recipes
"noumenios, matreas the pitanean, hegemon the thasian, who was called lentil-soup, artemidoros, who was called the pseudoaristophanean, and philoxenos, son of leukadios, wrote cookbooks"
"in addition, some flat-cakes took their names from philoxenos and were called philoxenean .zopyrinus  was an author of a work on cookery"
zopyrinus  was an author of a work on cookery. food played an important part in the greek mode of thought
"classicist john wilkins notes that ""in the odyssey for example, good men are distinguished from bad and greeks from foreigners partly in terms of how and what they ate"
"herodotus identified people partly in terms of food and eating"""
"up to the 3rd century bc, the frugality imposed by the physical and climatic conditions of the country was held as virtuous"
"the greeks did not ignore the pleasures of eating, but valued simplicity"
"the rural writer hesiod, as cited above, spoke of his ""flesh of a heifer fed in the woods, that has never calved, and of firstling kids"" as being the perfect closing to a day"
"nonetheless, chrysippus is quoted as saying that the best meal was a free one"
"culinary and gastronomical research was rejected as a sign of decadence: the inhabitants of the persian empire were considered so due to their luxurious taste, which manifested itself in their cuisine"
"the greek authors took pleasure in describing the table of the achaemenid great king and his court: herodotus, clearchus of soli, strabo and ctesias were unanimous in their descriptions"
"in contrast, greeks as a whole stressed the austerity of their own diet"
"plutarch tells how the king of pontus, eager to try the spartan ""black gruel"", bought a laconian cook; 'but had no sooner tasted it than he found it extremely bad, which the cook observing, told him, ""sir, to make this broth relish, you should have bathed yourself first in the river eurotas""'"
"according to polyaenus, on discovering the dining hall of the persian royal palace, alexander the great mocked their taste and blamed it for their defeat"
"pausanias, on discovering the dining habits of the persian commander mardonius, equally ridiculed the persians, ""who having so much, came to rob the greeks of their miserable living"""
"in consequence of this cult of frugality, and the diminished regard for cuisine it inspired, the kitchen long remained the domain of women, free or enslaved"
"in the classical period, however, culinary specialists began to enter the written record"
"both aelian and athenaeus mention the thousand cooks who accompanied smindyride of sybaris on his voyage to athens at the time of cleisthenes, if only disapprovingly"
"plato in gorgias, mentions ""thearion the cook, mithaecus the author of a treatise on sicilian cooking, and sarambos the wine merchant; three eminent connoisseurs of cake, kitchen and wine"
""" some chefs also wrote treatises on cuisine. over time, more and more greeks presented themselves as gourmets"
"from the hellenistic to the roman period, the greeks — at least the rich — no longer appeared to be any more austere than others"
the cultivated guests of the feast hosted by athenaeus in the 2nd or 3rd century devoted a large part of their conversation to wine and gastronomy
"they discussed the merits of various wines, vegetables, and meats, mentioning renowned dishes  and great cooks such as soterides, chef to king nicomedes i of bithynia"
"when his master was inland, he pined for anchovies; soterides simulated them from carefully carved turnips, oiled, salted and sprinkled with poppy seeds"
suidas  mistakenly attributes this exploit to the celebrated roman gourmet apicius  — which may be taken as evidence that the greeks had reached the same level as the romans
"orphicism and pythagoreanism, two common ancient greek religions, suggested a different way of life, based on a concept of purity and thus purification  — a form of asceticism in the original sense: ἄσκησις askēsis initially signifies a ritual, then a specific way of life"
vegetarianism was a central element of orphicism and of several variants of pythagoreanism
"empedocles  justified vegetarianism by a belief in the transmigration of souls: who could guarantee that an animal about to be slaughtered did not house the soul of a human being? however, it can be observed that empedocles also included plants in this transmigration, thus the same logic should have applied to eating them"
"vegetarianism was also a consequence of a dislike for killing: ""for orpheus taught us rights and to refrain from killing"""
the information from pythagoras  is more difficult to define
"the comedic authors such as aristophanes and alexis described pythagoreans as strictly vegetarian, with some of them living on bread and water alone"
"other traditions contented themselves with prohibiting the consumption of certain vegetables, such as the broad bean, or of sacred animals such as the white cock or selected animal parts"
"it follows that vegetarianism and the idea of ascetic purity were closely associated, and often accompanied by sexual abstinence"
"in on the eating of flesh, plutarch  elaborated on the barbarism of blood-spilling; inverting the usual terms of debate, he asked the meat-eater to justify his choice"
